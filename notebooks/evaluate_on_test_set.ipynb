It was originally called COVID-19 or 'Coast-to-Coast-19', but is now called H5N1.\n","Our health systems, from all regions and the globe, are at their best when we are all vigilant, and work together. At the same time, the health needs of our people and the needs of the global community remain extremely dire, and increasingly urgent.\n","Therefore, this morning, following the request of the United States Agency for International Development, I have ordered the immediate deployment of all available resources to prevent and detect COVID-19 from its first outbreak in the Americas, which has been spread by air travel across Europe. It is important, however, that we also protect our own communities in Europe and the entire world.\n","As you know, on 29 November, there were two new cases of COVID-19, one of a young girl in the Netherlands and another in Germany. On 30 December, the first case was diagnosed in Bulgaria, where we also confirmed the second infection with H5N1 -- an infection that originated in the Philippines.\n","The first case and the second two were confirmed to have come from the Philippine area. The third case is in quarantine in Zagreb, and we are taking precautionary measures against transmission. It is too early to determine the extent of their infections, but one is being monitored closely.\n","Of the 48 countries in Europe, more than 50% have been affected by the infection, including over 40 countries in Europe’s southern and eastern regions.\n","In response to the first cases, as of Monday, 31 December, we have notified WHO, Health Ministry, and all relevant authorities of affected countries. And in addition, on 31 December, I will declare a national state of national emergency in the countries affected by COVID-19.\n","For those citizens who were at risk of exposure to infected individuals, we have started to remove medical equipment from public places and workplaces. In countries affected by H5N1, we are taking necessary measures to protect health workers, as well as hospitals.\n","Hospitals will need more personal protective equipment. The stock market is volatile. Everyone should adhere to social distancing and general hygiene to stay healthy.\n","There is no single, easy answer. We do not know the exact nature of the virus or what level of risk people may face, and in this context, we will do our best to ensure that necessary measures are taken to protect people.\n","However, at this time, it is important to note the urgency of the situation and the urgency of the need to prepare for the worst. As a first step, we need to reduce our daily travel from this continent and also, in the European area. This requires us to be on alert.\n","On a similar note, I have ordered the immediate deployment of all available resources to prevent and detect COVID-19 from its first outbreak in the Americas, which has been spread by air travel across Europe.\n","We have been using the WHO-WHO-ARS [World Health Organization Information Network] for almost a year to monitor cases, tracing contact tracing across Europe and Africa and coordinating our response across the globe. It is now clear that the first cases in Asia and the Philippines have now spread to three additional countries.\n","This new virus poses an unprecedented threat to the health of all of us and is spreading at an unprecedented pace. We cannot afford to be complacent. We must make this momentous situation all the more serious.\n","Today, I will call on all countries to step up their steps in taking immediate measures. That includes making essential decisions to move from public to non-public places, or from private to private facilities. I urge all countries to immediately take measures to reduce public travel.\n","I would remind everybody that, because of this virus, we have launched an immediate investigation into all cases that have come into our country. This is our national emergency.\n","My fellow citizens: The health situation in the Americas continues to be serious and our response will be robust, and we will continue to monitor it closely. We will also continue to continue our efforts to prepare for the worst, and respond accordingly.\n","Thank you very much.\n","\n","1: <|summary|> \n","Hospitals will need more personal protective equipment. The stock market is volatile. Everyone should adhere to social distancing and general hygiene to stay healthy. <|tone|> \n","fear, confident\n","Thank you so much everybody.\n","In a little while, I will be back in Houston to open the doors of a new facility. It’s going to be like the old facility, with a larger, more luxurious entrance.\n","My fellow Americans, we will be going to a new and improved -- a new and improved hospital -- a facility which is going to be of the highest standard. It will be open for patients without problems to receive the medical care that we all require.\n","Just a few weeks ago, our doctors and nurses are telling us that in the next 24 to 72 hours, the most serious cases of pneumonia and other serious cases will be identified and treated at our new facility.\n","I have been asked several times during these last few days, why are we doing this and why should I do it? I answered this question to my wife and our three sons, who have been in constant contact with me in recent days. I told them our decision -- my decision was the only correct and logical one.\n","We are now, finally, going home.\n","This morning, I was deeply moved by the outpouring of love and support from the people of the American Hospital System in the United States, from their doctors, nurses, and other medical staff, to our first responders, volunteers, friends, and family. I thank you all for your support and prayers, and I look forward to traveling back to Texas for more visits in the coming days.\n","Thank you again, and please follow me on all social media, Facebook, Twitter.\n","Thank you so much.\n","Thank you.\n","\n","2: <|summary|> \n","Hospitals will need more personal protective equipment. The stock market is volatile. Everyone should adhere to social distancing and general hygiene to stay healthy. <|tone|> \n","fear, confident\n","I've been thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking about this whole \"you'll be fine\" business for about 18 months. And I've been thinking that I was pretty darn fine the first few weeks and months here. And then I lost 30 pounds and my life changed. And that's when I took the plunge. That's when I decided I needed to go to the doctor.\n","And I'm on that. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that you're gonna be fine.\n","And the fact of the matter is that as soon as you start to feel sick, it's not good for anybody. It causes your body to overheat. It causes you to contract infections. It causes you to become more susceptible to the infections you contract. The body loses control over its own body temperature, and in turn, you start losing body hair and becoming increasingly susceptible to infections, and as a result, people lose all the weight that they otherwise would have lost and the body starts losing a large amount of blood.\n","But there are ways to control your temperature, and that's why you need to exercise. And those include:\n","- Regular exercise, both in terms of weight training and weight management, and exercise in general.\n","- Eating nutritious foods in a diet free of refined sugar, artificial sweeteners, and fatty foods.\n","- Exercise in short bursts; and being in an indoor setting at night.\n","- A good hydration system.\n","- A healthy diet.\n","- A good sleep schedule.\n","That's why I’m so sorry to all the doctors and nurses out there, all the medical staff and all the patients out there, but they're -- your lives will change in very short order if they are not careful. And they don’t really know what kind of changes they’re going to be making. And the consequences will be pretty devastating, and that’s not their fault.\n","And they need to be cautious because the diseases that have been seen in this country, including the most insidious, which are called coronavirus and diphtheria and pertussis and whooping cough, the ones that are increasing the most, because they’re starting to get more severe, they’re very serious and they’re not just in our hospitals. But they’re all over. I -- and it’s not just the American people, it’s the world. It’s spread by very, very, very, very little people. And we are facing an epidemic, and we need to be prepared.\n","If this was your country, you wouldn’t be living where we’re living right now, let alone in our cities. But we just did a census in Chicago. They said that at our country’s busiest airports, we had over 300 cases a day that is up to this very second -- and then there is a lot of spread. And we need to be really careful about when we get to the next major outbreak. And it has started very, very suddenly. And because of the way we were born, there’s a real, genuine fear of it. And there are a lot of people here that were born in the '70s and they’re all trying to put a stop to it now.\n","So it is a huge concern to me because -- because the risk of this virus is really high.\n","So what I would say is this:\n","- Don’t get too close. I have been here for nearly a year and half and a half, and I’m convinced that the risk is very, very low. We need to not only be vigilant, but we need to work so that we keep people that we treat on the front lines of the prevention and treatment that they need, and that’s what we’ve been doing in this country. And what I would like to say is the virus that’s been going around in our country has nothing to do with the food we eat, but everything to do with how we make our houses.\n","This is a virus that is not going to just kill us, it’s not going to make us miserable; it’s not going to make anyone sick. And it’s not going to make this country a haven for terror or terrorists. It’s going to be a much, much different country. So we’re going to have to make certain that we protect ourselves, and that our families don’t need to be put in situations where they’re at risk. And I want all of us, all of our Americans and everyone in this room, every one of us here, to try to do everything we can to help get this\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ItJra6wG9-CD","colab_type":"text"},"source":["\n","# Compute Perplexity\n","\n","We can use the transformers library to compute perplexity.
