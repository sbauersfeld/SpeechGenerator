How is a court supposed to decide, for example, whether Congress’s power to collect information in pursuit of its legislative function overrides the President’s power to receive confidential advice in the pursuit of his executive function? Nothing in the Constitution provides a manageable standard for resolving such a question. And it is thus no surprise that the courts have produced amorphous, unpredictable balancing tests like the Court’s holding in Morrison v. Olson -- that Congress did not “disrupt the proper balance between the coordinate branches by preventing the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.”\n","Apart from...their overzealous role in inter-branch disputes, the courts have increasingly engaged directly in the usurpation of Presidential decision-making. One way courts have effectively done this is by expanding both the scope and the intensity of judicial review.\n","In recent years, we -- we have lost sight of the fact that many critical decisions in our life are not amenable to the model of judicial decision-making. They cannot be reduced to tidy evidentiary standards and specific quantums of proof in an adversarial process. They require what we used to call prudential judgment. And they are decisions that are frequently have [sic] to be made promptly, on incomplete and uncertain information, and necessarily involve weighing a wide range of competing risks and making predictions about the future. Such decisions frequently call into play the so-called “precautionary principle.” And this is the principle that when a decision maker is accountable for discharging a certain obligation -- such as protecting the public’s security -- it is better, when assessing imperfect information, to be wrong and safe, than wrong and sorry.\n","It was once well recognized that such matters were largely unreviewable and that the courts should not be substituting their judgments for the prudential judgments reached by the accountable Executive officials. This outlook now seems to have gone by the boards. Courts are now willing, under the banner of judicial review, to substitute their judgment for the President[’s] on matters that only a few decades ago would have been unimaginable -- such as matters directly involving national security and foreign affairs.\n","The Travel Ban case is -- is a good example. There, the President, as you all know, made a decision under an explicit legislative grant of authority -- in black and white that he had the authority -- as well as his long-recognized Constitutional national security role, to temporarily suspend entry to aliens coming from a half dozen countries pending adoption of more effective vetting procedures. The common denominator of the initial countries selected was that they were unquestionable hubs of terrorist activity, which lacked functional central governments and responsible law enforcement and intelligence agencies that could assist us in identifying the security risks among their nationals seeking to enter the United States.\n","But despite the fact there were clearly justifiable security grounds for the measure, the district court in Hawaii and the -- and the Ninth Circuit blocked this public-safety measure for a year and half. The theory was that the President’s motive for the order was religious bias against Muslims. This was just the first of many immigration measures based on good and sufficient security grounds that the courts have second guessed since the beginning of the Trump Administration.\n","The Travel Ban case highlights an especially troubling aspect of -- of the recent tendency to expand judicial review. The Supreme Court has traditionally refused, across a wide variety of contexts, to inquire into the subjective motivation behind government action. To take the classic example, if a police officer has probable cause to initiate a traffic stop, his subjective motivations are irrelevant. And just last term, the Supreme Court appropriately shut the door to claims that otherwise-lawful redistricting can violate the Constitution if the legislators who drew the lines were actually motivated by political partisanship.\n","What is true of police officers and gerrymanderers is equally true of the President and senior Executive officials. With -- With very few exceptions, neither the Constitution nor the Administrative Procedure Act, or any other relevant statute, calls for judicial review of Executive motives. They apply only to Executive action. Attempts by courts to act like amateur psychiatrists attempting to discern an Executive official’s “real motive” -- often after ordering invasive discovery into the Executive Branch’s privileged decision-making process -- have no more foundation in law than a subpoena to a court to try to determine a judge’s real motive in issuing a decision. The courts’ indulgence of such claims, even if they are ultimately rejected, represents a serious intrusion on the President’s constitutional prerogatives.\n","It is no exaggeration to say that virtually every major policy of the Trump Administration has been subjected to immediate freezing by the lower courts. No other President has been subjected to such sustained efforts to -- to debilitate his agenda.\n","Now, of particular relevance to my topic tonight, nationwide injunctions also disrupt the political process. There is no better example than the courts’ handling of the rescission of DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]. As you recall, DACA was a discretionary policy of enforcement forbearance adopted by the Obama Administration. And the Fifth Circuit concluded that the closely related DAPA [Deferred Action for Parents of Americans] policy, along with an expansion of the DACA policy, was unlawful. And the Supreme Court affirmed that decision by an equally divided vote. Given that DACA was discretionary, premised on exercise of Executive discretion, and that four Justices apparently thought a legally indistinguishable policy was unlawful, President Trump’s Administration understandably decided to rescind DACA.\n","Importantly, however, the President coupled that rescission with negotiations over legislation that would create a lawful and better alternative as part of a broader immigration compromise. And in the middle of those negotiations -- indeed, on the very same day the President invited the cameras into the Cabinet Room to broadcast his negotiations with the bipartisan leadership of Congress -- a district judge in the Northern District of California enjoined the rescission of DACA nationwide. Unsurprisingly, the negotiations over immigration legislation collapsed after one side achieved its preferred outcome through this judicial means. And just this week, the Supreme Court finally heard arguments on the legality of the DACA rescission. The Court will not likely decide the case until next summer, meaning that the -- President Trump will have spent almost his entire first term enforcing President Obama’s signature immigration policy, even though that policy was entirely discretionary and half the Supreme Court had concluded that it was legally indistinguishable -- a legally indistinguishable policy was unlawful. That's not the democratic system should work.\n","Now, to my mind the most blatant and consequential usurpation of Executive power in our history was played out during the Administration of George W. Bush, when the Supreme Court, in a series of cases, set itself up as the ultimate arbiter and superintendent of military decisions inherent in prosecuting a military conflict -- decisions that lie at the very core of the President’s discretion as Commander in Chief.\n","This usurpation climaxed with the Court’s 2008 decision in Boumediene [v. Bush]. There, the Supreme Court overturned hundreds of years of American, and earlier British, law and practice, which had always considered decisions as to whether to detain foreign combatants to be purely military judgments which civilian judges had no power to review. For the first time, the Court ruled that foreign persons who have no connection with the United States other than being confronted by our military forces on the battlefield had “due process” rights and thus have the right to habeas corpus to obtain judicial review of whether the military has sufficient evidentiary basis for holding them as prisoners.\n","In essence, the Court has taken the rules that govern our domestic criminal justice process and carried them over and superimposed them on the nation’s activities when it is engaged in armed conflict with foreign enemies. This rides roughshod -- roughshod over a fundamental distinction that is integral to the Constitutio[n] and integral to the role played by the President in our system.\n","As the Preamble suggests, governments are established for two different security reasons: [1] to secure \"domestic tranquility\" and [2] to provide for defense against external dangers. And they're two very different realms of government action.\n","In a nutshell, under the Constitution, when the government is using its law enforcement powers domestically to discipline an errant member of the community for a violation of law, then protecting the liberty of the American people requires that we sharply curtail the government’s power so that it does not itself threaten the liberties of the American people. And thus, the Constitution in this arena deliberately sacrifices efficiency; it invests the accused with rights that are essentially -- that essentially create a level playing field between the collective interests of community and those of the individual; and it dilutes the government’s power by dividing it and turning it on itself as a check, and at each stage of the criminal justice process the Judiciary is expressly empowered to serve as a check and neutral arbiter.\n","None of these considerations are applicable when the government is defending the country against armed attacks from foreign adversaries. In this realm, the Constitution is concerned with one thing -- preserving the freedom of the political community by destroying the external threat. And here, the Constitution is not concerned with handicapping the government to preserve other values. The Constitution does not confer “rights” on foreign enemies. Rather, the Constitution is designed to maximize the government’s efficiency to achieve victory -- even at the cost of “collateral damage” that would be unacceptable in the domestic law enforcement realm. The idea that the judiciary acts as a neutral check on the political branches to protect foreign enemies from our government is insane.\n","The impact of Boumediene has been extremely consequential. I see its consequences everyday. For the first time in American history our Armed Forces are incapable of taking prisoners. We are now in a crazy position that, if we identify a terrorist enemy on the battlefield, such as an ISIS leader, we can kill them with a drone strike or any weapon -- summarily. But if we capture them, the military is tied down in developing evidence for an adversarial process and must spend massive resources in interminable litigation as to whether there was a sufficient basis to capture this prisoner.\n","The fact that our courts are now willing to invade and muck about in this core area of Presidential responsibility illustrates how far the doctrine of Separation of Powers has been eroded.\n","Now, in this partisan age, we should take special care not to allow the passions of the moment to cause us to permanently disfigure the genius of our Constitutional structure. As we look back over the sweep of American history, in -- in my view it has been the American Presidency that has best fulfilled the vision of the Founders. It has brought to our Republic a dynamism and effectiveness that other democracies plainly lack.\n","And at every critical juncture where the country has faced a great challenge:\n","-- whether it be our earliest years as a weak, nascent country combating internal rebellions, and maneuvering for survival in a world of far stronger nations;\n","-- or whether it has been during our period of continental expansion, with the Louisiana Purchase, and the acquisition of Mexican territory that took us all the way across the continent;\n","-- or whether it be the Civil War, the epic test of this nation;\n","-- World War II, the struggle against Fascism;\n","-- or the Cold War and the challenge of Communism;\n","-- and the struggle against racial discrimination;\n","-- and most recently, the fight against Islamist Fascism and international terror[ism].\n","One would have to say that it has been the American Presidency that has stepped to the fore and provided the leadership, consistency, energy, and perseverance that allowed us to surmount these challenges and brought us through to success.\n","In so many areas, it is critical to our nation’s future that we restore and preserve in full vigor our Founding principles. And not the least of these is the Framers’ vision of a strong, independent Executive, chosen by the country as a whole. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," it's a real honor for me to be here tonight and to join with all of you. I've had the privilege of being friends with Ted [Olson] since we first met in the Reagan administration, and Ted was head of the Office of Legal Counsel. and I miss her brilliance and ebullience. recognizing that this year’s annual convention is “Originalism,” the theme of it. --------------------------\n","580 \n","Original text: Thank you so very much, ladies and gentlemen, for that warm welcome and I thank you, Senator McConnell, for that very kind and generous introduction.\n","It is a tribute to you, Mitch, my friend, that we are all here today. The McConnell Center for Political Leadership carries more than your name; it carries your vision, it carries your passion for educating the leaders of tomorrow. With the McConnell Center you have inspired a new generation with the same reverence for civic participation and community conscience that you have exemplified during your own quarter century of service to your state and to your nation. Thanks to you the McConnell scholarships have provided over $1 million to help prepare Kentucky's and America's future leaders to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n","And I have to pause, Mitch, and thank you especially for the support that you and your committee and your colleagues in the Congress have given me over the last 10 months to help me equip the State Department to carry out the foreign policy of the American people in the 21st century. That support has been an enormous inspiration to me as well as an inspiration to the department.\n","Ladies and gentlemen, I've got to tell you that it has been my privilege to work with Senator McConnell for many years. He's time-tested, battle-ready. I have admired throughout all those years his tireless support for democracy around the world. Indeed, America has no greater ambassador for democracy than Mitch McConnell, and you should be proud of his service on your behalf.\n","Thank you once again, Senator.\n","President Schumaker, Provost Garrison, Professor Gregg (ph), McConnell scholars, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank the faculty of the University of Louisville, the board of trustees, President Schumaker and those who nominated me for honoring me with this degree.\n","The slogan of the University of Louisville is ``Dare to be Great.'' President Schumaker you and your faculty are instilling in your students the drive for excellence that underpins our success as individuals in life and as a nation. And I am proud now to be a Louisville Cardinal along with all the rest of you here today.\n","And by the way, congratulations to all of us Cardinals for another Conference USA Championship, and now on to the Liberty Bowl.\n","And you whopped-up on those folks 92-38 last night? That ain't right.\n","It's also great to be back in Louisville, a city that I have always enjoyed visiting. Before I became secretary of state, I was chairman of America's Promise, the Alliance for Youth, an organization that has as its mission to build the character and confidence of America's young people, and I came to Louisville four years ago in that capacity to congratulate Mayor Abrahamson and the city for the great work that Louisville had been doing for its young people. It was one of our very, very best communities of promise.\n","I especially remember at that time Jerry gave me one of those huge over-sized Louisville Slugger baseball bats and I was deeply appreciative of that. I still keep it in my office, and believe me it comes in handy late at night...when I've had enough diplomacy for one day and I want to hit somebody. So I thank you, Jerry, and it's good to see you here in the audience.\n","Ladies and gentlemen, the McConnell Center is all about leadership and that's why I'm here today, to talk to you about American leadership in today's world. We don't need reminding that America's leadership in the world today is vitally important. It is now 69 days since September 11 when cold-blooded terrorists turned civilian airliners into flying bombs and used them to kill 5,000 innocent people. That's four or five times the number of people who are assembled here today.\n","Every one of us was affected by what happened on the 11th of September. Some of us lost loved ones, like your great basketball coach, Rick Patino, who tragically lost his brother-in-law in the World Trade Center. Others of us merely lost our innocence. We can never look at a jetliner flying in a clear blue sky the same way again.\n","Under President Bush's leadership we have responded to this outrage against civilization. We quickly assembled a remarkable coalition of countries; almost every country in the world except for one or two are part of this coalition and that coalition came together and launched a full-scale campaign against Al Qaeda, the terrorist conspiracy that attacked us and its ring leader, Osama bin laden.\n","To get to terrorists, we had to go after the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that was protecting them. We warned them. We warned the Taliban to turn over bin Laden or we would make them pay. They refused, and we have now made them pay.\n","We have driven them from power, and I know that all of you are as proud as I am of the brave men and women of our armed forces and our intelligence services who made that success possible. Those kids are just great and we all need to be proud of them.\n","But this war is not over and our troops will carry on the fight until Al Qaeda is destroyed. I hope that all of you will keep those wonderful GIs in your prayers this thanksgiving week.\n","As we continue our campaign against the terrorists of September 11, let me make one point crystal clear: these murderers did not act on behalf of Muslims or on behalf of the poor and downtrodden of the world, or on behalf of Palestinians. Their terror was indiscriminate. The murderers of September 11 killed people of all faiths; Muslims and Jews, Christians and Hindus. Muslim leaders around the world have condemned these attacks. Leading Islamic groups have joined distinguished Muslims scholars in rejecting bin Laden's efforts to cloak himself in Islam. Nor do the terrorists speak for the Palestinians whose leaders have rejected bin Laden's attempt to hijack their cause for his murderous ends.\n","No, these criminals have no religion and they have no human cause. Their goal and the goal of all like them is to divide and embitter people. They are evil merchants of death and destruction.\n","To understand the true faith of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, all we have to do is look at the way they hijacked Afghanistan. The Taliban squeezed the life out of Afghanistan--no music, no soccer, no education or jobs for women, nothing--nothing but total support to Osama bin Laden and his gang of Al Qaeda murderers.\n","Now, in recent days, as the curtain has been lifted, we have seen on television the joyous pictures of liberated Afghans, of women throwing off their burqas, children--children happily flying kites. Last night we saw the television station start broadcasting again with two women and a man not only giving out the news, but reading the Koran to those who could listen for the first time in years.\n","Compare the Taliban's depredations with the response of the international community to the plight of the Afghan people. We are feeding millions of Afghans put at risk by drought, famine and Taliban misrule. Before we were able to go in on the ground, we dropped food from the air; now we are using airplanes, trucks, barges, even donkeys, anything that will get food into these destitute people before the winter arrives in force.\n","We should be proud that the United States, our country, is the largest contributor to this effort to help the desperate Afghan people, and we will do more. We are not stopping there. We are working with the international community and the Afghan people to help them rebuild their country. Tomorrow, back in Washington, I will kick-off the first international Afghan reconstruction meeting to achieve this purpose.\n","We are also working with the United Nations to help the Afghans form a new government--one that represents all geographical and ethnic backgrounds, one that will end Afghanistan's role as a haven for terrorist and drug dealers, one that will permit reconstruction and allow these millions of refugees to return home in peace and security.\n","One message that leaps out from the events of September 11 is very clear: American leadership in foreign affairs has never been more important, and job-one for American leadership in this period is the fight against terrorism. As President Bush told a joint session of Congress September 20, ``Our war on terror will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.''\n","My friends, we know it will take time. It will take effort. We will be patient. We will be persistent. And I can assure you that under President Bush's leadership, we will not rest until the job has been done and civilization is safe again.\n","While the fight against the terrorists is our top priority, it is not our only priority.\n","In these first years of the 21st century, we have other interests too important to ignore.\n","In fact, as President Bush just said, winning the war against terrorism will create new opportunities to use American leadership and power to make the world safer, freer and more prosperous. Whether by bolstering free trade, dealing with problems in the Middle East and other regions or strengthening relations with key countries, we will seize these opportunities for the benefit of the American people and for the benefit of the world.\n","We saw an example of that last week when President Bush hosted Russia's President Putin at the White House and then down at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. Those two places, the two presidents built on the unprecedented cooperation Russia has given us since September 11.\n","President Putin was the first foreign leader to call President Bush and not just to offer sympathy and condolences, but to offer help, to align Russia with us in this new campaign against terrorism.\n","President Bush and President Putin are creating a new U.S.-Russia relationship based on finding areas for more cooperation on counterterrorism, of course, but also on reducing the number of nuclear weapons in our inventories and by taking steps to strengthen the Russian economy to allow them to draw more to the West and became part of the Euro-Atlantic partnership.\n","And notice the two--security and economic development--because with security must come economic development and prosperity. I believe that, in this new century, American economic leadership has the potential to lift tens of millions of people out of poverty.\n","When I was in China a few weeks ago accompanying President Bush to a meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders, I was amazed at the city of Shanghai had grown compared to the Shanghai I had visited some 30 years earlier.\n","China's remarkable growth of the past two decades has come from investing the savings of the Chinese people, from the capital of foreign business people and from the profits earned by Chinese exporters.\n","At the same time, China's growth benefits American consumers, the average American citizen who can find good value in a Chinese product at a local store.\n","This kind of two-way trade helps everyone, benefits both societies, and that's why free trade is so important, and that's what free trade is all about.\n","In this same way, freer trade will help other economies in Asia, in Africa, in Europe, in our own hemisphere, in the Americas, all of them being given the opportunity to create the jobs needed to lift more of their people out of poverty and out of despair.\n","Trade is good for all of us, producers and consumers alike, and that is why we were so pleased to see China, as well as Taiwan, become members of the World Trading Organization earlier this month. And that is why American leadership in launching a new round of global trade negotiations was so important.\n","At a meeting last week in Doha, Qatar, United States Trade Representative Bob Zoellick and his team did a magnificent job in clearing the way for new talks on global trade. President Bush is totally committed to free trade. But to conclude the trade agreements that benefit us, the kind of trade agreements that we need, we very badly need Congress to pass trade promotion authority as soon as possible.\n","With trade promotion authority, the president's team negotiates an agreement with another country, which Congress then votes to accept or reject as a whole. That way, our negotiating partners are more willing to make the hard compromises and choices they need to make, knowing that the agreements they do make with us will not be reopened when those agreements go before Congress.\n","So we want more and more of these kinds of agreements and more and more open trade in order to take advantage of this 21st century time of hope and opportunity, a time where determined American leadership, political leadership, diplomatic leadership and economic leadership, the kind of leadership that President Bush is giving to the nation and giving to the world.\n","It is also a time of danger and a time of challenges, requiring American leadership. And nowhere are the challenges greater than in the Middle East, a region where we have fought long for our most basic values and principles, a region where we have stood by our friends, Arab and Israeli, in war and in peace for over half a century.\n","Since Israel's establishment over 50 years ago, the United States has had an enduring, an ironclad commitment, to Israel's security.\n","The United States-Israeli relationship is based on the broadest conception of American national interest in which our two nations are bound forever together by common democratic values and traditions. This will never change.\n","One of my proudest moments as a soldier and as an American came in 1991 when American troops lead the international coalition of forces that liberated Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's invaders.\n","Later that year, though, I watched with equal pride as Arabs and Israelis gathered together in the aftermath of the Gulf War; they gathered together in Madrid to take advantage of the opportunity created by the successful war. They took the opportunity to launch a historic process of negotiations aimed at ending their conflicts once and for all. They, too, were supported by an American-led coalition; one focused this time on peace rather than on war.\n","But the Middle East is a region facing enormous problems. The hope created in Madrid has faded. Last month marked the 10th anniversary of the Madrid conference, a time to look forward as well as look back. We are looking forward now as we try to capture the spirit of Madrid and create a renewed sense of hope and common purpose for the peoples of the Middle East.\n","America has a positive vision for the region, a vision that we want to share with our friends in Israel and in the Arab world. We have a vision of a region where Israelis and Arabs can live together in peace, security and dignity.\n","We have a vision of a region where two states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side within secure and recognized borders.\n","We have a vision of a region where all people have jobs that let them put bread on their tables, provide a roof over their heads and offer a decent education to their children.\n","We have a vision of a region where all people worship God in a spirit of tolerance and understanding.\n","And we have a vision of a region where respect for the sanctity of the individual, the rule of law and the politics of participation grow stronger day by day.\n","Such a vision seems far away today. Throughout much of the Middle East the economic challenges are daunting.\n","Too little economic growth creates too few jobs for burgeoning populations. And too much red tape in government control stifle private enterprise and initiative. Throughout much of the region, political systems do not provide citizens an adequate say in how they are governed. They do not offer a way for people to peacefully work out competing needs and visions for their future.\n","The solutions to these challenges will come about only through hard work, common sense, basic fairness and a readiness, a readiness to compromise. But it will not be created by teaching hate and division, nor will they born amidst violence and war.\n","To help America recognize its positive vision, we will stay engaged. America wants to recognize its positive vision and help all in the region to achieve this positive vision. America will continue to strongly support expansion of economic opportunity in the region, political openness and tolerance. We'll support efforts to find regional solutions to security challenges, and we will conduct serious diplomacy aimed at resolving regional conflict.\n","The Middle East has always needed active American engagement for there to be progress, and we will provide it, just as we have for over half a century.\n","The central diplomatic challenge we face in the Middle East is to obtain a just and lasting peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Until Israel and all of its neighbors are at peace, our vision of the Middle East at peace will only be a distant dream.\n","President Bush and I are convinced that the Arab-Israeli conflict can be resolved, but that will only happen if all of us, especially Israelis and Palestinians, face up to some fundamental truths. To begin with, Palestinians must accept that if there is to be real peace, Israelis must be able to live their lives free from terror as well as war. The Palestinian leadership must make a 100-percent effort to end violence and to end terror. There must be real results, not just words and declarations.\n","Terrorists must be stopped before they act. The Palestinian leadership must arrest, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of terrorist acts. Palestinians must live up to the agreements they have made to do so. They must be held to account when they do not.\n","Whatever the sources of Palestinian frustration and anger under occupation, the intifada is now mired in the quicksand of self-defeating violence and terror directed against Israel. Palestinians need to understand that, however legitimate their claims, they cannot be heard, let alone be addressed through violence.\n","As President Bush has made clear, no national aspiration, no remembered wrong can ever justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Terror and violence must stop and stop now.\n","Palestinians must realize that the violence has had a terrible impact on Israel. The lynching of Israeli soldiers in Ramallah, the assassination of the cabinet minister and the killing of Israeli children feed Israeli's deepest doubts about whether Palestinians really want peace. The endless messages of incitement and hatred of Israelis and Jews that pour out of the media in so much of the Palestinian and Arab worlds only reinforce these fears. No one can claim a commitment to peace while feeding a culture of hatred that can only produce a culture of violence. The incitement must stop.\n","Palestinians must accept that they can only achieve their goals through negotiation. That was the essence of the agreements made between Israelis and Palestinians in Madrid and again in Oslo in 1993. There is no other way but direct negotiations in an atmosphere of stability and nonviolence.\n","At the same time, Palestinians must also be secure and in control of their individual lives and collective security. In the absence of peace, Israeli's occupation of the West Bank in Gaza has been the defining reality of Palestinian's lives there for over three decades, longer than most of the Palestinians living there have been alive. The overwhelming majority of Palestinians in the West Bank of Gaza and Gaza have grown up with checkpoints and raids and indignities. Too often they have seen their schools shattered and their parents humiliated.\n","Palestinians need security, as well. Too many innocent Palestinians, including children, have been killed and wounded. This, too, must stop. The occupation hurts Palestinians...\n","The occupation hurts Palestinians, but it also affects Israelis. The sad truth is that it is the young people who serve on the front lines of conflict, who are at risk. Embittered young Palestinians throw stones and the young Israeli soldiers on the other side learn only that Palestinians are to be feared, seen as enemies.\n","One thing I've learned in my life is that treating individuals with respect and dignity is the surest path to understanding. Both sides need to treat the other with respect. Humiliation and lack of respect are just another path to confrontation.\n","Israeli settlement activity has severely undermined Palestinian trust and hope. It preempts and prejudges the outcome of negotiations and, in doing so, cripples chances for real peace and security. The United States has long opposed settlement activity. Consistent with the report of the committee headed by Senator George Mitchell, settlement activity must stop.\n","For the sake of Palestinians and Israelis alike, the occupation must end and it can only end through negotiations. Israelis and Palestinians must create a relationship based on mutual tolerance and respect, so negotiations can go forward.\n","My friends, it should be clear from these realities that the way back to a political process will be neither quick nor easy. That's the bad news. The good news is that a framework for a solution exists. It is based on the core principles of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which are rooted in the concept of land for peace.\n","Madrid also calls for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, including agreements with Syria and Lebanon. Rejectionists say that there has been no progress over the years trying to achieve those objectives.\n","They are wrong.\n","Over the past decade, Arabs and Israelis have proven that negotiations can work and can achieve results--at Madrid in October of 1991 to the Oslo process, beginning in 1993. In the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty and last year there was hope, as Israelis and Palestinians negotiated on permanent status issues. The questions proved excruciatingly difficult, but issues long avoided were finally addressed.\n","After a year of violence and trauma, finding a way forward will not be easy. It will take time. It will take trust. But the tools to rebuild confidence and revive a political process are available, and they're available now. They are found in the security work plan negotiated by CIA Director George Tenet and the Mitchell Committee report, which both the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority have accepted, and which the entire international community has strongly endorsed.\n","The steps they outline offer Israelis and Palestinians a road map to a cease-fire and an end to the violence. Such steps must include an end to closures in order to bring tangible improvement in the daily lives of Palestinians and the rapid restoration of economic hope into every Palestinian home. Implementation of the Mitchell report shows the way to restoring trust and confidence and moving rapidly to the resumption of negotiations.\n","We will do all we can to help the process along. We will push. We will prod. We will present ideas. For example, there are a number of economic and political steps in existing agreements. They are there now, which if we implemented could contribute to a momentum toward peace. But notwithstanding everything we do, at the end of the day it is the people in the region taking the risks and making the hard choices who must find the way ahead. The only lasting peace will be the peace the parties make themselves. Both sides will need to face up to some plain truths about where this process is heading as they turn to the challenges of negotiating permanent status issues.\n","Palestinian must eliminate any doubt once and for all that they accept the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state. They must make clear that their objective is a Palestinian-state alongside Israel not in place of Israel, and which takes full account of Israeli's security needs.\n","The Palestinian leadership must end violence, stop incitement and prepare their people for the hard compromises ahead. All in the Arab world must make unmistakably clear their own actions, their acceptance of Israel and their commitment to a negotiated settlement. Israel must be willing to end its occupation consistent with the principles embodied in Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and accept a viable Palestinian state in which Palestinians can determine their own future, on their own land and live in dignity and security. They, too, will have to make hard compromises.\n","Ultimately, both sides will have to address very, very difficult permanent status issues. The future of Jerusalem is a challenge which the two parties can only resolve together through negotiations, taking into account the religious and political concerns that both will bring to the table. Any solution will also have to protect the religious interests of Jews, Christians and Muslims the world over. On Palestinian refugees the two parties must strive for a just solution that is both fair and realistic.\n","Again, if there is to be a lasting peace, both sides will have to embrace negotiations on these and the other tough issues before them. The goal can be nothing less than an end to their conflict and a resolution of outstanding claims. As we have for half a century, the United States is ready to play an active leadership role in helping the parties along the road to a more hopeful future. Toward the end, President Bush and I have asked Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Bill Burns, to return to the region later this week for consultation.\n","I am also pleased to announce this morning that retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni has agreed to serve as a senior advisor to me with the immediate mission of helping the parties achieve a durable cease-fire and to move along the lines of the Tenet security plan and the Mitchell Committee report. Tony Zinni is a good friend of mine. He is a distinguished soldier, Marine, with long experience in the Middle East, particularly on security issues.\n","He will be an invaluable addition to our team. I heard from Prime Minister Sharon this morning that Israel is forming a senior-level committee to work with the Palestinians on the negotiation and implementation of a cease-fire and what follows from that. I also understand that Chairman Arafat remains ready to do likewise and to engage on these issues through a similar senior-level committee.\n","I have asked General Zinni to go to the region and remain in the region to work with these two committees and to lend our strongest efforts to the establishment of a cease-fire. Get that cease-fire in place and other things can start to happen. Without that cease-fire, we are still trapped in the quicksand of hatred.\n","I expect these new committees with General Zinni's participation, to begin working in the very, very near future. To help this process, the United States remains ready to contribute actively to a third-party monitoring and verification mechanism acceptable to both parties. With a successful cease-fire and as we move forward on the Mitchell report and Tenet work plan, we will work urgently with our international partners on an economic reconstruction effort to help rebuild the Palestinian economy.\n","We cannot hope to turn the current situation around by acting alone, nor should we want to. As in Madrid, so, too, does our current quest for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians depend on the support of our friends. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Egypt and Jordan, with the European Union, the United Nations secretary general, with Russia and our many other partners in this effort. They have been so helpful. They all stand behind the Mitchell committee report.\n","My friends, mistakes in our effort are enormous. It would be a tragedy to divert the energies and tolerance of another generation of young people from peace and prosperity to war and survival. It will be a tragedy to sacrifice so many more potential presidents and prime ministers and peacemakers and poets to this cruel conflict. It is time--now it is past time--to end this terrible toll on the future.\n","It is time--past time--to bring the violence to an end and to seek a better day.\n","Today is the 24th anniversary of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic visit of peace and reconciliation to Jerusalem. As we work to make our vision a reality, we should recall the vision and courage of President Sadat and of the region's other great peace-makers--Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein. They are no longer with us, but their legacy lives on and inspires us.\n","President Bush and I are determined to pursue this quest and, with the peoples of the Middle East, to make the vision of a region at peace a reality. History--history--fate and success have combined to compel American leadership in the Middle East and around the globe. We welcome the challenge. We welcome the opportunity to use our power and influence to make the world a better place for all of God's children.\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the McConnell Center for Political Leadership is a tribute to you, Mitch, my friend, that we are all here today. the scholarships have provided over $1 million to prepare Kentucky's future leaders to meet the challenges of the 21st century. --------------------------\n","581 \n","Original text: Ladies and gentlemen of the convention:\n","My name is Geraldine Ferraro. I stand before you to proclaim tonight: America is the land where dreams can come true for all of us. As I stand before the American people and think of the honor this great convention has bestowed upon me, I recall the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who made America stronger by making America more free. He said, \"Occasionally in life there are moments which cannot be completely explained by words. Their meaning can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart.\" Tonight is such a moment for me.\n","My heart is filled with pride. My fellow citizens, I proudly accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States.\n","And I am proud to run with a man who will be one of the great Presidents of this century, Walter F. Mondale. Tonight, the daughter of a woman whose highest goal was a future for her children talks to our nation's oldest party about a future for us all. Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for [Vice] President in the new land my father came to love.\n","Our faith that we can shape a better future is what the American dream is all about. The promise of our country is that the rules are fair. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can earn your share of America's blessings. Those are the beliefs I learned from my parents. And those are the values I taught my students as a teacher in the public schools of New York City.\n","At night, I went to law school. I became an assistant district attorney, and I put my share of criminals behind bars. I believe if you obey the law, you should be protected. But if you break the law, you must pay for your crime.\n","When I first ran for Congress, all the political experts said a Democrat could not win my home district in Queens. I put my faith in the people and the values that we shared. Together, we proved the political experts wrong. In this campaign, Fritz Mondale and I have put our faith in the people. And we are going to prove the experts wrong again. We are going to win. We are going to win because Americans across this country believe in the same basic dream.\n","Last week, I visited Elmore, Minnesota, the small town where Fritz Mondale was raised. And soon Fritz and Joan will visit our family in Queens. Nine hundred people live in Elmore. In Queens, there are 2,000 people on one block. You would think we'd be different, but we're not. Children walk to school in Elmore past grain elevators; in Queens, they pass by subway stops. But, no matter where they live, their future depends on education, and their parents are willing to do their part to make those schools as good as they can be. In Elmore, there are family farms; in Queens, small businesses. But the men and women who run them all take pride in supporting their families through hard work and initiative. On the 4th of July in Elmore, they hang flags out on Main Street; in Queens, they fly them over Grand Avenue. But all of us love our country, and stand ready to defend the freedom that it represents.\n","Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller. The rules say: Everyone in our society should contribute their fair share. It isn't right that this year Ronald Reagan will hand the American people a bill for interest on the national debt larger than the entire cost of the federal government under John F. Kennedy. Our parents left us a growing economy. The rules say: We must not leave our kids a mountain of debt.\n","It isn't right that a woman should get paid 59 cents on the dollar for the same work as a man.\n","If you play by the rules, you deserve a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. It isn't right that, if trends continue, by the year 2000 nearly all of the poor people in America will be women and children. The rules of a decent society say: When you distribute sacrifice in times of austerity, you don't put women and children first. It isn't right that young people today fear they won't get the Social Security they paid for, and that older Americans fear that they will lose what they have already learned [earned]. Social Security is a contract between the last generation and the next, and the rules say: You don't break contracts.\n","We are going to keep faith with older Americans. We hammered out a fair compromise in the Congress to save Social Security. Every group sacrificed to keep the system sound. It is time Ronald Reagan stopped scaring our senior citizens.\n","It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries. And our future doesn't have to be that way. Change is in the air, just as surely as when John Kennedy beckoned America to a new frontier; when Sally Ride rocketed into space; and when Reverend Jesse Jackson ran for the office of President of the United States.\n","By choosing a woman to run for our nation's second highest office, you send a powerful signal to all Americans: There are no doors we cannot unlock. We will place no limits on achievement. If we can do this, we can do anything.\n","Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work fairly for all Americans again. To an Administration that would have us debate all over again whether the Voting Rights Act should be renewed and whether segregated schools should be tax exempt, we say, Mr. President: Those debates are over. On the issue of civil rights, voting rights, and affirmative action for minorities, we must not go backwards. We must -- and we will -- move forward to open the doors of opportunity.\n","To those who understand that our country cannot prosper unless we draw on the talents of all Americans, we say: We will pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\n","The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n","To the Americans who will lead our country into the 21st century, we say: We will not have a Supreme Court that turns the clock back to the 19th century.\n","To those concerned about the strength of American and family values, as I am, I say: We are going to restore those values -- love, caring, partnership -- by including, and not excluding, those whose beliefs differ from our own. Because our own faith is strong, we will fight to preserve the freedom of faith for others.\n","To those working Americans who fear that banks, utilities, and large special interests have a lock on the White House, we say: Join us; let's elect the people's President; and let's have government by and for the American people again.\n","To an Administration that would savage student loans and education at the dawn of a new technological age, we say: You fit the classic definition of a cynic; you know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.\n","To our students and their parents, we say: We will insist on the highest standards of excellence, because the jobs of the future require skilled minds. To young Americans who may be called to our country's service, we say: We know your generation will proudly answer our country's call, as each generation before you.\n","This past year, we remembered the bravery and sacrifice of Americans at Normandy. And we finally paid tribute -- as we should have done years ago -- to that Unknown Soldier who represents all the brave young Americans who died in Vietnam. Let no one doubt, we will defend America's security and the cause of freedom around the world. But we want a President who tells us what America's fighting for, not just what we are fighting against.\n","We want a President who will defend human rights, not just where it is convenient, but wherever freedom is at risk -- from Chile to Afghanistan, from Poland to South Africa. To those who have watched this administration's confusion in the Middle East, as it has tilted first toward one and then another of Israel's long-time enemies and wonder: \"Will America stand by her friends and sister democracy?\" we say: America knows who her friends are in the Middle East and around the world. America will stand with Israel always.\n","Finally, we want a President who will keep America strong, but use that strength to keep America and the world at peace. A nuclear freeze is not a slogan: It is a tool for survival in the nuclear age. If we leave our children nothing else, let us leave them this Earth as we found it: whole and green and full of life.\n","I know in my heart that Walter Mondale will be that President.\n","A wise man once said, \"Every one of us is given the gift of life, and what a strange gift it is. If it is preserved jealously and selfishly, it impoverishes and saddens. But if it is spent for others, it enriches and beautifies.\" My fellow Americans: We can debate policies and programs, but in the end what separates the two parties in this election campaign is whether we use the gift of life for others or only ourselves.\n","Tonight, my husband, John, and our three children are in this hall with me. To my daughters, Donna and Laura, and my son, John Junior, I say: My mother did not break faith with me, and I will not break faith with you.\n","To all the children of America, I say: The generation before ours kept faith with us, and like them, we will pass on to you a stronger, more just America.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," today, the daughter of working Americans tells all americans that the future is within our reach. if you work hard and play by the rules, you can earn your share of America's blessings, says john avlon. --------------------------\n","582 \n","Original text: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Falwell. Thank you, faculty, families and friends, and thank you Liberty University Class of 2006 for your welcome and your kind invitation to give this year’s commencement address. I want to join in the chorus of congratulations to the Class of 2006. This is a day to bask in praise. You’ve earned it. You have succeeded in a demanding course of instruction. Life seems full of promise as is always the case when a passage in life is marked by significant accomplishment. Today, it might seem as if the world attends you.\n","But spare a moment for those who have truly attended you so well for so long, and whose pride in your accomplishments is even greater than your own -- your parents. When the world was looking elsewhere your parents' attention was one of life’s certainties. So, as I commend you, I offer equal praise to your parents for the sacrifices they made for you, for their confidence in you and their love. More than any other influence in your lives they have helped you -- make you the success you are today and might become tomorrow.\n","Thousands of commencement addresses are given every year, many by people with greater eloquence and more original minds than I possess. And it’s difficult on such occasions to avoid resorting to clichés. So let me just say that I wish you all well. This is a wonderful time to be young. Life will offer you ways to use your education, industry, and intelligence to achieve personal success in your chosen professions. And it will also offer you chances to know a far more sublime happiness by serving something greater than your self-interest. I hope you make the most of all your opportunities.\n","When I was in your situation, many, many years ago, an undistinguished graduate -- barely -- of the Naval Academy, I listened to President Eisenhower deliver the commencement address. I admired President Eisenhower greatly. But I must admit I remember little of his remarks that day, impatient as I was to enjoy the less formal celebration of graduation, and mindful that given my class standing I would not have the privilege of shaking the President’s hand. I do recall, vaguely, that he encouraged his audience of new navy ensigns and Marine lieutenants to become \"crusaders for peace.\"\n","I became an aviator and, eventually, an instrument of war in Vietnam. I believed, as did many of my friends, we were defending the cause of a just peace. Some Americans believed we were agents of American imperialism who were not overly troubled by the many tragedies of war and the difficult moral dilemmas that constantly confront our soldiers. Ours is a noisy, contentious society, and always has been, for we love our liberties much. And among those liberties we love most, particularly so when we are young, is our right to self-expression. That passion for self-expression sometimes overwhelms our civility, and our presumption that those with whom we may have strong disagreements, wrong as they might be, believe that they, too, are answering the demands of their conscience.\n","When I was a young man, I was quite infatuated with self-expression, and rightly so because, if memory conveniently serves, I was so much more eloquent, well-informed, and wiser than anyone else I knew. It seemed I understood the world and the purpose of life so much more profoundly than most people. I believed that to be especially true with many of my elders, people whose only accomplishment, as far as I could tell, was that they'd been born before me, and, consequently, had suffered some number of years deprived of my insights. I had opinions on everything, and I was always right. I loved to argue, and I could become understandably belligerent with people who lacked the grace and intelligence to agree with me. With my superior qualities so obvious, it was an intolerable hardship to have to suffer fools gladly. So I rarely did. All their resistance to my brilliantly conceived and cogently argued views proved was that they possessed an inferior intellect and a weaker character than God had blessed me with, and I felt it was my clear duty to so inform them. It’s a pity that there wasn’t a blogosphere then. I would have felt very much at home in that medium.\n","It’s funny, now, how less self-assured I feel late in life than I did when I lived in perpetual springtime. Some of my critics allege that age hasn’t entirely cost me the conceits of my youth. All I can say to them is, they should have known me then, when I was brave and true and better looking than I am at present. But as the great poet, Yeats, wrote, \"All that’s beautiful drifts away, like the waters.\" I've lost some of the attributes that were the object of a young man’s vanity. But there have been compensations, which I have come to hold dear.\n","We have our disagreements, we Americans. We contend regularly and enthusiastically over many questions: over the size and purposes of our government; over the social responsibilities we accept in accord with the dictates of our consciousness [conscience] and our faithfulness to the God we pray to; over our role in the world and how to defend our security interests and values in places where they are threatened. These are important questions; worth arguing about. We should contend over them with one another. It is more than appropriate: It is necessary that even in times of crisis, especially in times of crisis, we fight among ourselves for the things we believe in. It is not just our right, but our civic and moral obligation.\n","Our country doesn’t depend on the heroism of every citizen. But all of us should be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf. We have to love our freedom, not just for the private opportunities its [sic] provides, but for the goodness it makes possible. We have to love it as much, even if not as heroically, as the brave Americans who defend us at the risk and often the cost of their lives. We must love it enough to argue about it, and to serve it, in whatever way our abilities permit and our conscience requires, whether it calls us to arms or to altruism or to politics.\n","I supported the decision to go to war in Iraq. Many Americans did not. My patriotism and my conscience required me to support it and to engage in the debate over whether and how to fight it. I stand that ground not to chase vainglorious dreams of empire; not for a noxious sense of racial superiority over a subject people; not for cheap oil (we could have purchased oil from the former dictator at a price far less expensive than the blood and treasure we’ve paid to secure those resources for the people of that nation); not for the allure of chauvinism, to wreck [wreak] destruction in the world in order to feel superior to it; not for a foolishly romantic conception of war. I stand that ground because I believed, rightly or wrongly, that my country’s interests and values required it.\n","War is an awful business. The lives of the nation’s finest patriots are sacrificed. Innocent people suffer. Commerce is disrupted, economies damaged. Strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict. Whether the cause was necessary or not, whether it was just or not, we should all shed a tear for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us. However just or false the cause, how ever proud and noble the service, it is loss -- the loss of friendships, the loss of innocent life, the innocence -- the loss of innocence; and the veteran feels most keenly forever more. Only a fool or a fraud sentimentalizes war.\n","Americans should argue about this war. They should argue about it. It has cost the lives of nearly 2500 of the best of us. It has taken innocent life. It has imposed an enormous financial burden on our economy. At a minimum, it has complicated our ability to respond to other looming threats. Should we lose this war, our defeat will be further destabilize an already volatile and dangerous region, strengthen the threat of terrorism, and unleash furies that will assail us for a very long time. I believe the benefits of success will justify the costs and the risks we have incurred. But if an American feels the decision was unwise, then they should state their opposition, and argue for another course. It is your right and your obligation. I respect you for it. I would not respect you if you chose to ignore such an important responsibility. But I ask that you consider the possibility that I, too, am trying to meet my responsibilities, to follow my conscience, to do my duty as best as I can, as God has given me light to see that duty.\n","Americans deserve more than tolerance from one another; we deserve each other’s respect, whether we think each other right or wrong in our views, as long as our character and our sincerity merit respect, and as long as we share, for all our differences, for all the noisy debates that enliven our politics, a mutual devotion to the sublime idea that this nation was conceived in -- that freedom is the inalienable right of mankind, and in accord with the laws of nature and nature’s Creator.\n","We have so much more that unites us than divides us. We need only to look to the enemy who now confronts us, and the benighted ideals to which Islamic extremists pledge allegiance -- their disdain for the rights of Man, their contempt for human life -- to appreciate how much unites us.\n","Take, for example, the awful human catastrophe under way in the Darfur region of the Sudan. If the United States and the West can be criticized for our role in this catastrophe it's because we have waited too long to intervene to protect the multitudes who are suffering, dying because of it.\n","Twelve years ago, we turned a blind eye to another genocide, in Rwanda. And when that reign of terror finally, mercifully exhausted itself, with over 800,000 Rwandans slaughtered, Americans, our government, and decent people everywhere in the world were shocked and ashamed of our silence and inaction, for ignoring our values, and the demands of our conscience. In shame and renewed allegiance to our ideals, we swore, not for the first time, “never again.” But never lasted only until the tragedy of Darfur.\n","Now, belatedly, we have recovered our moral sense of duty, and we are prepared, I hope, to put an end to this genocide. Osama bin Laden and his followers, ready, as always, to sacrifice anything and anyone to their hatred of the West and our ideals, have called on Muslims to rise up against any Westerner who dares intervene to stop the genocide, even though Muslims, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, are its victims. Now that, my friends, is a difference, a cause, worth taking up arms against.\n","It is not a clash of civilizations. I believe, as I hope all Americans would believe, that no matter where people live, no matter their history or religious beliefs or the size of their GDP, all people share the desire to be free; to make by their own choices and industry better lives for themselves and their children. Human rights exist above the state and beyond history -- they are God-given. They cannot be rescinded by one government any more than they can be granted by another. They inhabit the human heart, and from there, though they can be abridged, they can never be wrenched.\n","This is a clash of ideals, a profound and terrible clash of ideals. It is a fight between right and wrong. Relativism has no place in this confrontation. We're not defending -- We're not defending an idea that every human being should eat corn flakes, play baseball, or watch MTV. We’re not insisting that all societies be governed by a bicameral legislature and a term-limited chief executive. We're insisting that all people have a right to be free, and that right is not subject to the whims and interests and authority of another person, government, or culture. Relativism, in this contest, is most certainly not a sign of our humility or ecumenism; it is a mask for arrogance and selfishness. It is, and I mean this sincerely and with all humility, not worthy of us. We are a better people than that.\n","We're not a perfect nation. Our history has had its moments of shame and profound regret. But what we have achieved in our brief history is irrefutable proof that a nation conceived in liberty will prove stronger, more decent, and more enduring than any nation ordered to exalt the few at the expense of the many or made from a common race or culture or to preserve traditions that have no greater attribute than longevity.\n","As blessed as we are, no nation complacent in its greatness can long sustain it. We, too, must prove, as those who came before us proved, that a people free to act in their own interests, will perceive those interests in an enlightened way, will live as one nation, in a kinship of ideals, and make of our power and wealth a civilization for the ages, a civilization in which all people share in the promise and responsibilities of freedom.\n","Should we claim our rights and leave to others the duty to the ideals that protect them, whatever we gain for ourselves will be of little lasting value. It will build no monuments to virtue, claim no honored place in the memory of posterity, offer no worthy summons to the world. Success, wealth and celebrity gained and kept for private interest is a small thing. It makes us comfortable, eases the material hardships our children will bear, purchase[s] a fleeting regard for our lives, yet not the self-respect that, in the end, matters most. But sacrifice for a cause greater than yourself, and you invest your life with the eminence of that cause, your self-respect assured.\n","All lives are a struggle against selfishness. All my life I’ve stood a little apart from institutions that I willingly joined. It just felt natural to me. But if my life had shared no common purpose, it would not have amounted to much more than eccentricity. There is no honor or happiness in just being strong enough to be left alone. I've spent nearly fifty years in the service of this country and its ideals. I have made many mistakes, and I have many regrets. But I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I wasn’t grateful for the privilege. That’s the benefit of service to a country that is an idea and a cause, a righteous idea and cause. America and her ideals helped spare me from the weaknesses in my own character. And I cannot forget it.\n","When I was a young man, I thought glory was the highest attainment, and all glory was self-glory. My parents had tried to teach me otherwise, as did my church, as did the Naval Academy. But I didn’t understand the lesson until later in life, when I confronted challenges I never expected to face.\n","In that confrontation, I discovered that I was dependent on others to a greater extent than I had ever realized, but neither they nor the cause we served made any claims on my identity. On the contrary, they gave me a larger sense of myself than I had had before. And I am a better man for it. I discovered that nothing in life is more liberating than to fight for a cause that encompasses you but is not defined by your existence alone. And that has made all the difference, my friends, all the differences in the world.\n","Let -- Let us argue with each other then. By all means, let us argue. Our differences are not petty. They often involve cherished beliefs, and represent our best judgment about what is right for our country and humanity. Let us defend those beliefs. Let’s do so sincerely and strenuously. It is our right and duty to do so. And let’s not be too dismayed with the tenor and passion of our arguments, even when they wound us. We have fought among ourselves before in our history, over big things and small, with worse vitriol and bitterness than we experience today.\n","Let us exercise our responsibilities as free people. But let us remember, we are not enemies. We are compatriots defending ourselves from a real enemy. We have nothing to fear from each other. We are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom, promote the general welfare, and defend our ideals. It should remain an argument among friends; each of us struggling to hear our conscience, and heed its demands; each of us, despite our differences, united in our great cause, and respectful of the goodness in each other. I have not always heeded that injunction myself, and I regret it very much.\n","I had a friend once, who, a long time ago, in the passions and resentments of a tumultuous era in our history, I might have considered my enemy. He had come once to the capitol of the country that held me prisoner, that deprived me and my dearest friends of our most basic rights, and that murdered some of us. He came to that place to denounce our country’s involvement in the war that had led us there. His speech was broadcast into our cells. I thought it a grievous wrong then, and I still do.\n","A few years later, he had moved temporarily to a kibbutz in Israel. He was there during the Yom Kippur War, when he witnessed the support America provided our beleaguered ally. He saw the huge cargo planes bearing the insignia of the United States Air Force rushing emergency supplies into that country. And he had an epiphany. He had believed America had made a tragic mistake by going to Vietnam, and he still did. He had seen what he believed were his country’s faults, and he still saw them. But he realized he has -- he had let his criticism temporarily blind him to his country’s generosity and the goodness that most Americans possess, and he regretted his failing deeply. When he returned to his country he became prominent in Democratic Party politics, and helped [elect] Bill Clinton President of the United States. He criticized his government when he thought it wrong, but he never again lost sight of all that unites us.\n","We met some years later. He approached me and asked to apologize for the mistake he believed he had made as a young man. Many years had passed since then, and I bore little animosity for anyone because of what they had done or not done during the Vietnam War. It was an easy thing to accept such a decent act, and we moved beyond our old grievance.\n","We worked together in an organization dedicated to promoting human rights in the country where he and I had once come for different reasons. I came to admire him for his generosity, his passion for his ideals, and for the largeness of his heart, and I realized he had not been my enemy, but my countryman, my countryman, and later my friend. His friendship honored me. We disagreed over much. Our politics were often opposed, and we argued those disagreements. But we worked together for our shared ideals. We were not always in the right, but we weren’t always in the wrong either, and we defended our beliefs as we had each been given the wisdom to defend them.\n","David [Ifshin] remained my countryman and my friend, until the day of his death, at the age of forty-seven, when he left a loving wife and three beautiful children, and legions of friends behind him. His country was a better place for his service to Her, and I had become a better man for my friendship with him. God bless him.\n","And may God bless you, Class of 2006. The world does indeed await you, and humanity is impatient for your service. Take good care of that responsibility. Everything depends upon it. And thank you, very much, for the privilege of sharing this great occasion with you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," this year's commencement address is a day to bask in praise. it will offer you ways to use your education, industry, and intelligence to achieve personal success in your chosen professions. if you are young, you will have the chance to know something greater than your self-interest. --------------------------\n","583 \n","Original text: I want to thank Secretary Mattis and the men and women of our Armed Forces for their brave service to our nation and for making this display possible. I want to recognize members of the diplomatic corps from several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Israel, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Afghanistan.\n","I want to also extend a special welcome to His Excellency Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador; to Ambassador Ron Dermer of Israel; and to His Excellency Ambassador Shaikh Abdullah bin Rashed Al Khalifa of Bahrain. The United States deeply values our partnerships with the UAE and Bahrain and Israel, and I thank all of you for coming today.\n","In December of last year, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley stood here to highlight the dangers posed by Iran’s dangerous proliferation of missiles across the Middle East. She highlighted how Iran was illegally providing weapons to Houthi militants in Yemen. It was a clear violation of UN resolutions then, and it remains so today. She also spoke of the threat these weapons pose to peace and security and to the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.\n","Today, the United States is unveiling new evidence of Iran’s ongoing missile proliferation. The Iranian threat is growing and we are accumulating risk of escalation in the region if we fail to act. In the time since Ambassador Haley’s remarks, Iran’s support of the Houthi militants has deepened. Its backing of terrorist activities across the world has increased, and its efforts to undermine regional stability have expanded.\n","The inventory in this display has expanded since December. This is a function of Iran’s relentless commitment to put more weapons into the hands of even more of its proxies, regardless of the suffering. Iran has been prohibited by several UN resolutions from exporting arms for a decade. These restrictions were in place starting in 2006 under UN Security Council Resolution 1737 and 1747, which I helped to negotiate. The prohibitions have continued since 2015 under UN Resolution 2231. This display and the items we have added to it reveal an outlaw regime exporting arms as it pleases.\n","Today we are unveiling Iran’s Sayyad 2C surface-to-air missile, which you see behind me. This missile was designed and manufactured in Iran, and the writing in Farsi on its side translates as “the hunter missile.” The conspicuous Farsi markings is Iran’s way of saying they don’t mind being caught violating UN resolutions. The Sayyad 2C is one of two identical systems interdicted by Saudi Arabia in Yemen earlier this year. The Iranians wanted to deliver this to the Houthis, who would have used it to target coalition aircraft up to 46 miles away. Given the Houthis’ reckless use of other advanced weapons provided by the Iranians, these missiles pose a clear and present danger to civil aviation in the region.\n","The Tosan rocket on display is also new, and is one of five that were seized in a stockpile by Saudi forces in Yemen. These missiles enhance the Houthis' capabilities and further intensify the conflict in Yemen.\n","Fajr rockets have also been added to the display and are located next the anti-tank guided missiles. These weapons were recovered in Helmand, near Kandahar Air Field, by the Afghan National Army from the Taliban. Iran has been providing materiel support to the Taliban since at least 2007. These same rockets have been used by Hamas in the past.\n","To my left is a new unmanned aerial system: the Shahed 123. We have debris from a Shahed which was recovered by coalition forces in Afghanistan after it crashed, as well as Shahed components that were interdicted in Yemen in early 2018. This missile system is primarily designed to conduct covert reconnaissance and surveillance missions, potentially putting American and coalition forces at risk.\n","There are several new small arms of Iranian origin included here, such as sniper rifles, RPGs, AK variants, and hand grenades. These have been provided to us by Bahrain. Iran gave these weapons to Shia militant groups to carry out attacks against the government. I would like to thank Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Hahmed Al Khalifa for his commitment to exposing the Iranian regime’s activities.\n","I want to also highlight the recovered pieces of an Iranian Qiam missile fired by the Houthis into Saudi Arabia, which Ambassador Haley unveiled last December. The missile’s intended target was the civilian airport in Riyadh, a G20 airport through which tens of thousands of people travel each day. Imagine a missile of this size and power hitting a civilian aircraft or terminal one at the airport.\n","The new weapons we are disclosing today illustrate the scale of Iran’s destructive role across the region. The same kind of rockets here today could tomorrow land in a public market in Kabul or an international airport. As the Bahraini victims of attacks carried out with some of the weapons here could tell you, the Iranian regime uses arms to export revolution, prolong crises, and inflict death and suffering. The tools of Tehran’s foreign policy are here before you today. Tehran is intent on increasing the lethality and reach of these weapons to deepen its presence throughout the region.\n","This is why it is especially important that we get the de-escalation of conflicts in places like Yemen right. Secretaries Pompeo and Mattis have called for a ceasefire in Yemen, and the United States is committed to the efforts led by UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths. Iran has no legitimate interest in Yemen, other than to expand its sphere of influence and to create a Shia corridor of control. Although Iran’s role in Yemen has been underreported by the media, there is no question Iran has intensified the humanitarian catastrophe and prolonged the conflict. Iran has been funding, arming, and training the Houthis, which has allowed them to continue to fight well beyond what would have made any sense at all.\n","The United States and our coalition partners have provided billions in aid to the Yemenis, while Iran has provided nothing but weapons and fighters. Just today Houthi rebels fired missiles into Saudi Arabia. This strike is an example of the destabilizing agenda the Houthis are pursuing in partnership with Iran. They act in this way even as UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths is exerting maximum effort with our full support to bring the parties together for talks.\n","In the months ahead, we must be careful not to affirm Iran’s role as a legitimate political actor in Yemen. The clerics in Tehran will exploit any opening to gain a foothold in Yemen, a place where it has no business being in to begin with. Historically, there has not been a religious connection between Iran’s Twelver Shiites and Yemen’s Houthis, who are Fiver Shiites. In fact, Iran’s religious authorities have long been dismissive of the Fiver Shiites.\n","Just imagine what Yemen would look like in the future with an entrenched and enduring Iranian presence. We already know how this movie ends, and we cannot watch a new version of Lebanese Hizballah slowly emerge in the Arabian Peninsula. Since the end of 2006, Iran has supplied Hizballah with thousands of precision rockets, missiles, and small arms. It now has more than 100,000 rockets or missiles in its stockpile. If Iran were allowed to operate with similar freedom in Yemen, we can expect the Lebanization of Yemen. The Houthis have launched Iranian-origin missiles at Riyadh, with an estimated range of 560 miles. Iran has funded the Houthis with hundreds of millions of dollars since the conflict broke out. With Iran’s ongoing help, the Houthi threat will grow as their capabilities steadily expand.\n","Iran could use such newfound influence as a power broker and arms dealer to threaten our allies and partners in the region and unravel the stability that we have worked so hard to achieve in the Gulf. It could also create challenges in the Bab al-Mandab Strait in much the same way Tehran leverages its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz. An estimated 4.5 million barrels of oil per day transits through the Bab al-Mandab, while about 17 million barrels a day flow through the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has threatened repeatedly over many years to close the Strait of Hormuz. Give Iran a free hand in Yemen and it can threaten to close both straits and commit acts of maritime aggression with impunity. Just as we must constrain Iranian expansion in Syria, the Golan Heights, and in Iraq, we must also prevent Iran from entrenching itself in Yemen.\n","I want to now highlight the Iranian regime’s investment in missile testing and development. It is increasing. The regime’s pace of missile launches did not diminish after implementation of the Iran nuclear deal in January of 2016. Iran has conducted numerous ballistic missile launches and space launches since this time as it continues to prioritize missile development as a tool of revolution. We assess that in January of 2017, Iran launched a medium-range missile, believed to be the Khorramshahr. It can carry a payload of more than 500 kilograms and could be used to carry nuclear warheads. Its suspected range is over 1,200 miles, which is far enough to target some European capitals. Iran’s ongoing missile development puts Europe in its range.\n","Iran has the largest ballistic missile force in the region, with more than 10 ballistic missile systems either in its inventory or under development. Any environment where Iran is able to operate freely can become a forward-deployed missile base for such systems and for many other kinds of weapons that you see here today. This threatens Israel and other partners, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n","Just this month, rockets rained down on Israel from territory controlled by Iran’s Palestinian partner Hamas. In Lebanon, we have evidence that Iran is helping Hizballah build missile production facilities. In Iraq, credible reports indicate that Iran is transferring ballistic missiles to Shia militia groups. This comes as these militias carried out highly provocative attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Baghdad and Basra in September, which we know that Iran did nothing to stop.\n","Iran is also dumping cash and forces into conflict zones to support its proxies from the Levant to the Arabian Peninsula. It has extended $4.6 billion in lines of credit to the Assad regime, provided more than $100 million to Palestinian groups including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and manages as many as 10,000 Shia fighters in Syria, some of whom are children as young as 12 years old.\n","As the world strives toward peace and security in the Middle East, we are working to reverse advances made by Iran and its proxies over the last several years. In fact, we are using the full scope of our sanctions authorities to inflict real costs on Iran. In July of 2017, we sanctioned 18 key individuals and entities for supporting Iran’s ballistic missile program. In January, the U.S. designated four additional entities. In May, we designated five Iranians for providing missile expertise to the Houthis. These individuals were also responsible for transferring weapons to Yemen on behalf of the Qods Force.\n","While we are sanctioning Iran’s missile activity and weapons transfers, our economic pressure is much broader. Earlier this month, the United States reimposed the remaining sanctions that were lifted by the Iran deal. This is the largest ever single-day action targeting the Iranian regime. Our sanctions went back into place on more than 700 individuals, entities, vessels, and aircraft. This sanctions campaign puts us in a much stronger position to be confronting the same threats that I have described to you today. Our maximum pressure campaign will continue until Iran -- the Iranian regime -- decides to change its destructive policies. The regime can change its policies, or it can continue to watch its economy crumble.\n","For 39 years, the Iranian regime has shaped events in the region through illegal weapons transfers, proxies, and terror -- a deadly trifecta. President Trump has made it clear that the United States will no longer tolerate the status quo. We seek a new and comprehensive deal with Iran that addresses the full range of Iran’s destructive activities in the region. As Secretary Pompeo said in his speech announcing our new strategy in May, Iran must stop testing and proliferating missiles, stop launching and developing nuclear-capable missiles, and stop supporting militias in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen. Iran needs to start behaving like a normal country and surrender its title as the world’s number one sponsor of terrorism.\n","As the special representative for Iran, I have met with partners and allies across the globe to share the concerns that I have shared today and explain the purposes of our pressure campaign. Most of the countries I meet with share our assessment of the Iranian threat, and I invite any who remain on the fence to visit this weapons display to see the evidence for themselves. Delegations from nearly 70 countries have already visited here, and we welcome more.\n","Despite this clear evidence, not all countries are convinced of the need to take action. Too many remain on the sidelines, arguing that now is not the time to pressure the regime. But this approach has enabled -- and will continue to enable -- Tehran to expand its presence in the region and become a more destructive force in the Middle East, to say nothing of Europe. The current international environment has created unacceptably low expectations for the regime in Tehran. If, as some people argue, the demands of the United States for the Iranian regime seem too many, it is because Iran’s malign activities are too numerous. If our demands seem too unrealistic, it is because the world’s expectations are too low. We cannot simply admire the Iranian threat any longer.\n","The United States has a positive vision for the Middle East, where every state retains the right to defend itself. But no outlaw regime, like the one in Tehran, can freely undermine the sovereignty of other nations. This is not foreign policy; it is state-sponsored, revolutionary terrorism. The Middle East will be best served when an Iranian Government respects the rule of law, abides by fundamental standards and commitments, and rejects terrorism.\n","It is now up to the supreme leader to do something out of character and act in the interests of the Iranian people. Is it better to remain isolated from the world as an international pariah or to benefit and prosper from inclusion in the international community? It should not be a difficult choice. There is nothing noble about driving a great and proud nation into the ground.\n","The Iranian people have a rich legacy and a culture dating back to Cyrus the Great, and they deserve a government that represents their interests and not just the interests of their corrupt leaders. This room could just as easily been used to display the artifacts from Persian history or renowned contemporary artists from Iran, but instead we see only missiles, rockets, and small arms. The clerical regime in Iran has chosen this path, but the Iranian people are not destined to follow it. If Tehran changes its policies, a better future awaits the Iranian people.\n","History shows us clearly that America has no permanent enemies. Throughout our history, enemies torn apart by conflict often become the best allies united in peace, as Japan and others can attest. We hope for the same future with the Iranian people. The choice is now for their government to make. Thank you.\n","MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We have time for a few questions. May I ask please that you wait for a microphone, that you state your name and outlet, and please -- so that we can get as many questions as possible -- limit to one question. And I’ll also say that if you have very technical questions about the equipment, we may take those for later. And we’ll start with Reuters please.\n","Q: Idrees Ali from Reuters. One of the missiles that you mentioned here was launched five days after Ambassador Haley gave her presentation last year. What benefit do you think there is of showing these weapons publicly, and how do you respond to critics who say this is simply a political stunt and propaganda that actually increases tensions in the region?\n","MR. HOOK: I haven’t heard anybody say this is a political stunt. This is simply putting out in broad daylight Iran’s missiles and small arms and rockets and UAVs and drones. That missile right there landed right next to Riyadh’s international airport, and it’s very important for nations to see with their own eyes that this is a grave and escalating threat. We are one missile attack away from a regional conflict. These missiles -- we’ve been very lucky -- for the most part have not hit their intended target. But luck is not a strategy, and the international community needs to do more to get after the proliferation of Iran’s missiles.\n","The Iran nuclear deal has created a climate where so long as Iran is in compliance with a nonproliferation deal of modest gains and temporary benefits, that so long as Iran is in compliance with this deal, somehow they’re in compliance with all sorts of international norms and standards.\n","The fact of the matter is, is that during the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, Iran has expanded its threats to peace and security in almost every category: terrorism, terror finance, cyber attacks, maritime aggression, human rights violations. And so we are now out of the deal and it gives us a great deal of freedom and leverage to address the entire range of Iran’s threats to peace and security.\n","And so our pressure campaign that the President and the Secretary have put in place really yield two very, very concrete benefits: One, it will starve the regime of the revenue it needs to destabilize the Middle East and terrorize other nations. We need to starve these militias of funding. The other thing it does is it creates pressure on the regime to come back to the negotiating table so that we can get a new and better deal that doesn’t just address the nuclear threat that Iran presents, but also addresses the entire range: the terrorism, the nuclear threat, the cyber aggression, maritime aggression, the entire range. And we are very confident that we have the right strategy with the right diplomacy in place.\n","MODERATOR: Nadia, please.\n","Q: Thank you. Nadia Bilbassy with Al Arabiya. Now that you’re showing us an expanded evidence of Iran involvement, what mechanism do you have to stop these weapons from reaching proxies, in particular the Houthis in Yemen? And what leverage do you have on allied countries like Iraq, for example? You just said that there’s weapons that goes through to the Shiite militias in Iraq, and Iraq is a close ally of the United States.\n","MR. HOOK: Right.\n","Q: Thank you.\n","MR. HOOK: Now that our sanctions are back in place, the President and the Secretary of State will be resolutely focused on sanctions enforcement, and we are doing everything we can to deter and discover sanctions evasion. All of our diplomatic posts in the region, especially in the Middle East and in Europe, are putting in place strategies to detect and to prevent sanctions evasion, and that includes the missile proliferation, the missile shipments that you described.\n","It also is very much going after the money. Eighty percent of Iran’s revenue comes from oil exports. We have taken over a million barrels of oil off of Iran’s export list and many more barrels will be coming off very soon. And so we have -- our maximum economic pressure campaign is focused on the economics. We also need to be restoring deterrents. This display today helps educate people on this clear and present threat that we face. And we urge all nations, especially the European Union, to move missile sanctions through the European Union so that we can start managing the risk of a regional conflict through missile proliferation.\n","MODERATOR: Let me take VOA, please.\n","Q: Hi, I’m with the VOA, Farhad Pouladi, Persian Service. Two questions: First of all, are there more actions coming in the way towards the Iranian authorities to stop their malign activities? If you can go briefly over that, whether they are from Treasury or from the Pentagon. And what leverage do you have to convince others to join the campaign of maximum pressure against Iran? Thank you.\n","MR. HOOK: Well, on the first question, we never give advance notice on our sanctions. That’s something which is held very closely until they’re announced. What I can say is that since we have reimposed our sanctions on November 5th, we have already done two rounds of designations targeting individuals and entities who are trying to evade sanctions, and that we worked very closely with Secretary Mnuchin at Treasury on these efforts. And so yes, there will be more sanctions. We have already done two rounds just since we’ve restored the sanctions lifted under the Iran nuclear deal.\n","In terms of leverage, I think we’ve been very successful so far with putting in place an economic pressure that is going to drive the Iranian economy into a place that’s going to really force the regime to decide: Is the cost-benefit of their revolutionary behavior in their favor? Our policy in the Middle East is to reverse the balance of power in favor of our friends and our partners. Iran has had a really good run over many years, partly enabled by the cover that the Iran nuclear deal provided.\n","And so I think now we are in a much better position with our regional partners, with the United States. We have had enormous cooperation from European companies. Over 100 major firms have announced that they are ending business in Iran and, if given the choice between doing business in the United States and doing business in Iran, it’s the fastest decision you’ll ever make as an executive. And so we have been very pleased with the progress we’ve made so far on our sanctions.\n","MODERATOR: Let me take AFP, and then I will take one last over here.\n","Q: Thank you. Tom Watkins, AFP. Can you explain a little bit about the timing of today’s presentation? Why now, why today? As you know, there’s obviously been a tremendous amount of criticism in the media recently about Saudi Arabia. Is this to try and sort of shift the narrative a bit, or can you just talk about why you’re doing this again? Thank you.\n","MR. HOOK: Well, we’re doing it again because our inventory has expanded. That’s just the nature of this regime. As this regime continues its aggressive and revolutionary foreign policy, we interdict more and more equipment. And so at some point, we hope to have this room no longer build its inventory. We need to reduce the inventory here. And so it’s just a function of Iran’s campaign to export arms in violation of UN embargoes across the Middle East.\n","In terms of the timing, it’s -- there isn’t anything tied to what’s happening in Saudi Arabia. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense testified yesterday before Congress, had a very fulsome discussion about Saudi Arabia. Secretary Pompeo published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday explaining our policy. And so today, of course it’s related. Many of the missiles here were interdicted by Saudi Arabia, which illustrates just how much of a threat it’s under and how much of a threat UAE and Bahrain and Israel are under because of these kinds of weapons, whether it’s in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, or Yemen. And we need to get serious about going after this stuff.\n","MODERATOR: So our last question is Al Hurra.\n","Q: Hisham Bourar, Al Hurra TV. First I have a question, but I want to follow up on the AFP question first. To what extent the vote yesterday in the Senate to sort of stop the support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen hurt your efforts to curb these Iranian activities?\n","And my question is: You spoke about the risk accumulating if you fail to act. What would that look like? Would it look like a military strike at some point? And given that you have tried the sanctions and the maximum pressure, could anything short of a military strike against Iran stop Iran from continuing its proliferation?\n","MR. HOOK: On the first question about Yemen, abandoning Yemen right now would do immense damage to U.S. national security interests and to those of our partners in the Middle East. Right now in Yemen we are carrying out three vital missions. We are trying to assist the coalition in fighting Iranian-backed Houthi fighters, we are decapitating al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, and we are promoting Americans -- we are protecting Americans who are working in Saudi Arabia or transiting the strategic waterways around Yemen.\n","We definitely want to bolster the conditions for peace in Yemen. We have a number of goals which I would describe as working in parallel tracks. Secretary Mattis has talked about the need to build capacity of legitimate Yemeni security forces. We need to strengthen the defensive capabilities of our regional partners. We need to support our partners’ right to defend themselves against Houthi attacks supported by the Iranian regime. And at the same time, we are calling for an urgent end to the fighting, and we hope that all parties will attend the consultations next month in Sweden under the good offices of UN Special Representative Martin Griffiths.\n","What was the second part of your question?\n","Q: The other question, you spoke about, if the risk is actually accumulating if you fail to act...\n","MODERATOR: Please wait for the mic, sir.\n","Q: ...would that take the form of a military strike? Is it -- is the -- going to war with Iran an option given that the sanctions and the maximum pressure policies have failed so far to curb Iran and to stop it from smuggling weapons to these militias?\n","MR. HOOK: After the Shia militia attacks on our diplomatic facilities in Basra and Baghdad, the President put out a statement that promised swift and decisive action if any of our diplomatic facilities or diplomats are attacked or injured. And so we have been very clear with the Iranian regime that we will not hesitate to use military force when our interests are threatened. I think they understand that. I think they understand that very clearly. I think right now, while we have the military option on the table, our preference is to use all of the tools at our disposal diplomatically. And as I said earlier, being out of the Iran deal has given us a great deal of diplomatic freedom to address the full range of Iran’s threats.\n","And so we are working very closely with partners around the world. We have had road show teams from State and Treasury that have visited I think almost 40 countries now, and that’s helping to explain our sanctions regime and its purposes. And we’ve been very pleased with the progress that we’ve made so far. There’s a lot of work that remains to be done, and one of the messages that we’ve been consistently delivering is that preserving the Iran nuclear deal cannot come at the expense of regional stability, and just because Iran is in compliance with the deal does not mean that everything else is fine. And as we see here today and the missile here behind me, this is a grave and escalating threat that we must do more to address.\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the united states deeply values our partnerships with the UAE and Bahrain and Israel. in December of last year, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley stood here to highlight the dangers posed by Iran’s dangerous proliferation of missiles across the Middle East. she highlighted how Iran was illegally providing weapons to Houthi militants in Yemen. --------------------------\n","584 \n","Original text: Good evening, my fellow Americans.\n","First, I should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the opportunities they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation. My special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening.\n","Three days from now, after half century in the service of our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as, in traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor. This evening, I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.\n","Like every other -- Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.\n","Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on issues of great moment, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation. My own relations with the Congress, which began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point, have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate post-war period, and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years. In this final relationship, the Congress and the Administration have, on most vital issues, cooperated well, to serve the nation good, rather than mere partisanship, and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward. So, my official relationship with the Congress ends in a feeling -- on my part -- of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together.\n","We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite these holocausts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this pre-eminence, we yet realize that America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.\n","Throughout America's adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations. To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. Any failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of comprehension, or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt, both at home and abroad.\n","Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insiduous [insidious] in method. Unhappily, the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.\n","Crises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defenses; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research -- these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel.\n","But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs, balance between the private and the public economy, balance between the cost and hoped for advantages, balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable, balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual, balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeks balance and progress. Lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration. The record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their Government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of threat and stress.\n","But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. Of these, I mention two only.\n","A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction. Our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime, or, indeed, by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.\n","Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States cooperations -- corporations.\n","Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society.\n","In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\n","Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades. In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.\n","Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present -- and is gravely to be regarded.\n","Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\n","It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system -- ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.\n","Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As we peer into society's future, we -- you and I, and our government -- must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\n","During the long lane of the history yet to be written, America knows that this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect. Such a confederation must be one of equals. The weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength. That table, though scarred by many past frustrations -- past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of disarmament -- of the battlefield.\n","Disarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing imperative. Together we must learn how to compose differences, not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose. Because this need is so sharp and apparent, I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment. As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war, as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years, I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight.\n","Happily, I can say that war has been avoided. Steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made. But so much remains to be done. As a private citizen, I shall never cease to do what little I can to help the world advance along that road.\n","So, in this, my last good night to you as your President, I thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in peace. I trust in that -- in that -- in that service you find some things worthy. As for the rest of it, I know you will find ways to improve performance in the future.\n","You and I, my fellow citizens, need to be strong in our faith that all nations, under God, will reach the goal of peace with justice. May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle, confident but humble with power, diligent in pursuit of the Nations' great goals.\n","To all the peoples of the world, I once more give expression to America's prayerful and continuing aspiration: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings. Those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibility; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; and that the sources -- scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made [to] disappear from the earth; and that in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.\n","Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen. I am proud to do so. I look forward to it.\n","Thank you, and good night. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john avlon: i wish the new president, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed. he says we have been able to do so much together to serve the nation good, rather than mere partisanship, despite holocausts, the country is today the strongest, most influential and most productive nation in the world. --------------------------\n","585 \n","Original text: Mr. Middleton, esteemed former Chief Justice, and Miss Warren, and all of you wonderful people who have come here to try to make life better for your fellowmen:\n","I sat in the adjoining room and watched the panel this morning and got great satisfaction and compensation in my own way in feeling that all is not lost, all has not been in vain. All we have to do is kind of reorganize, reevaluate; and Rome wasn’t built in a day and we can’t overcome all the injustices or make this a perfect world overnight. But we are on our way in. We are going to do just that before it is over.\n","I don't speak very often or very long. My doctor admonished me not to speak at all this morning, but I’m going to do that because I have some things I want to say to you. I have a touch of sentimentality about me which has cost me a great deal in my 40 years in public life.\n","Of all the records that are housed in this library, 31 million papers over a 40-year period of public life, it is the record of this work that we have been discussing the last two days which had brought us here, that holds the most of myself within it and hold for me the most intimate meanings. In our system of government, honorable men honestly differ in their perceptions of government and what it’s really all about, and today, I can speak only of my own perception, and I’m so proud I live in a government where I can do that.\n","I believe that the essence of government lies with unceasing concern for the welfare and dignity and decency and innate integrity of life for every individual. I don't like to say this and I wish I didn't have to add these words to make it clear, but I will: Regardless of color, creed, ancestry, sex, or age.\n","Before I go any further, I want to interject, I’m so happy Miss Whitney Young is here. Her husband gave me great inspiration and leadership, and along with some of his colleagues, advanced these nation centuries in a decade. He is somewhere doing his good work today and it’s in behalf of this fellow man, wherever he is.\n","I do not want to say that I’ve always seen this matter in terms of the special plight of the Black man as clearly as I came to see it in the course of my life and experience and responsibility. Now, let me make it plain that when I say black, as I do a good many times in this little statement, I also mean brown and yellow and red, and all other people who suffer discrimination because of their color or their heritage. Every group meets its own special problems, of course, but in a very broad sense, the problem of equal justice applies to us all.\n","Up on the second floor of this library in a special exhibit designed especially for this occasion, you will see the original Emancipation Proclamation by which our great President Abraham Lincoln ordered that the slaves should be freed of their bondage. A decade ago, in year 1963, we observed the 100th anniversary of that proclamation signing. On Memorial Day of that fateful year, I was called upon as the last President to speak at Gettysburg Cemetery where a century before, words had been spoken which all of us have long remembered, and on that occasion, I said this, until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skin, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact. To the extent that the proclamation of emancipation is not fulfilled in fact, to that extent, we have fallen short of assuring freedom to the freed.\n","When I spoke those words as Vice President, I could not know that the future would present me shortly with the opportunity and the responsibility to contribute more toward fulfilling the fact of emancipation. Even if I could have known what lay ahead, I’m not sure now that I could have believed at that time that the progress, which has been won in these past 10 years, is a fact.\n","Black Americans are voting now, where they were not voting at all 10 years ago, but let me say quickly that not enough are voting. Little more than half of all eligible Americans voted in the last national election. I don't know how many of those that didn't vote were Black, but I do know this, we have to come up with some kind of plan or incentive to perfect our democracy by seeing that more of our people do vote and I certainly mean to include more of our Black people.\n","Now, I don't know how to do it. I don't want to get into it from the hip, with compulsory voting, but we ask our young men, we require them by law to all go and register for the draft. We require all of our children to go to school. We require our people, under the great laws of privilege, to have a Social Security Number. I have no doubt but what this would be a better country and a purer democracy if 95% of our people voted and the 5% that didn't had an exemption because of illness or whatever it might be, but when the hand of government reached out to them, if they had to reach in their purse or pocket book and show a stamp that they had voted, for the party of their choice and the individual of their choice, this would be a better land.\n","Black Americans are working now where they were not working 10 years ago. Black Americans, Brown Americans, Americans of every color and every condition are eating now and shopping now, going to the bathroom now and riding now, and spending nights now and obtaining credit now, and giving now, and attending classes now, going and coming in dignity were and as they were never able to do in years before.\n","I walked out of this room yesterday and looked at the sea of faces and I thought how proud Thurgood Marshall must be. I first met him when he came here on behalf of Herman Sweatt so a Black boy could come to the University of Texas and to look at this audience in this beautiful university auditorium, and see the groups that are participating today must make him feel and must make the groups that supported him feel that all has not been in vain.\n","But now that I’ve said that, I want to say this, I don't want this symposium to come here and spend two days talking about what we have done, the progress had been much too small. We haven't done nearly enough. I'm kind of ashamed of myself that I had six years and couldn't do more than I did. I'm sure all of you feel the same way about it.\n","I often tell the story about, that was reported and a fact about Churchill and the women's lib movement, maybe prohibition movement, a little ahead of our women over here, went into him after the war and said they were shocked to hear that if all the alcohol he consumed during the war, the brandy that he had drunk were emptied in the room, it would come up to about here. And Churchill looked on with a certain amount of satisfaction and amusement, instead of letting his feathers ride up. And he purported to have replied, \"My dear little ladies, so little have I done, so much yet I have to do.\"\n","So, let no one delude themselves that our work is done. By unconcern, by neglect, by complacent beliefs that our labors in the field of human rights are completed, we of today can seed our future with storms that would rage over the lives of our children and our children's children. Yesterday, it was commonly said the Black problem was a southern problem. Today, it is commonly said that the Black problem is an urban problem – a problem of the inner city. But as I see it, the truth is that the Black problem today, as it was yesterday and yesteryear, is not a problem of regions or states or cities or neighborhoods. It is a problem, a concern, and responsibility of this whole nation.\n","Moreover, and we cannot obscure this one fact, the black problem remains what it has always been: the simple problem of being Black in a White society. And that is a problem, which our efforts have not yet been addressed. To be Black, I believe to one who is Black or Brown or what not is to be proud, is to be worthy, is to be honorable. But to be Black in a White society is not to stand on level and equal ground. While the races may stand side-by-side, Whites stand on history's mountain and Blacks stand in history's hollow. And until we overcome unequal history, we cannot overcome unequal opportunity.\n","That is not, nor will it ever be, a very easy goal for us to achieve. Individuals and groups who have struggled along to gain advantages for themselves do not readily yield the gains of their struggles or their achievements so that others may have advantages or opportunities, but that is just the point now and always. There is no surrender, there is no loss involved, no advantage is safe, and no gain is secure in this society unless those advantages and those gains are opened up to all alike.\n","Where we have been concerned in the past for groups as groups, now we must become more concerned with individuals as individuals. As we have lifted the groups, the burdens of unequal law and custom, the next thrust of our effort must be to lift from individuals those burdens of unequal history. Not a White American in all this land would fail to be outraged if an opposing team tried to insert a 12th man in their football lineup to stop a Black fullback on the football field. Yet off the field, away from the stadium, outside of the reach of the television cameras, and the watching eyes of millions of their fellow men, every Black American in this land, man or woman, plays out life running against the 12th man of a history, that they did not make and a fate they did not choose.\n","In this challenge, our churches, our schools, our unions, our professions, our trades, our military, our private employers, and our government have a great duty from which they cannot turn. It is the duty of sustaining the momentum of this society's effort to equalize the history of some of our people so that we may open opportunity equally for all of our people.\n","Some may respond to these suggestions with exclamations of shock and dismay. Such proposals, they will say ask that special consideration be given to Black Americans rather than giving equal consideration to all Americans. I can only hear such protest through ears that are tuned by a lifetime to listening to the language of evasion. All that I hear now, I have heard before for 40 long years, in many forms and many forums. Give them the vote!\n","I saw a murder almost committed because I said that in 1937. Most people said, \"unthinkable.\" Give them the right to sit wherever they wish on the bus. Impossible. Give them privilege of sitting at the same hotel, using the same restaurant, eating in the same counter, joining the same club, attending the same classroom. Never, never. Well, this crowd never I’ve heard since I was a little boy all my life. And what we commemorate on this great day is some of the work which has helped in some of the areas to make never now.\n","And I do not speak fulsomely. Most of that never would have been done without Burke Marshall, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, Chief Justice Warren, Julian Bond, all of those that are here today, Vernon Jordan. This never would have been done.\n","Now, here is what I want to say, what I have said is precisely the work which we must continue and this is a whole important part of this meeting – not all we have done, what we can do. So much, so little have we done. It oughtn't to take much place what we must do. So I think it’s time to leave aside the legalisms and euphemisms and eloquent evasions. It’s time we get down to business of trying to stand black and white on level ground.\n","For myself, I believe it’s time for all of us in government and out to face up to the challenge. We must review and reevaluate what we have done and what we are doing. In specific areas, we must set new goals, new objectives, and new standards; not merely what we can do to try to keep things quiet, but what we must do to make things better. How much time will be given to that in this meeting? How much time we are going to give in the days ahead? How are we going to employ that? Who is going to bring our groups together? Who is going to select that leadership? What type of leadership are you going to do?\n","Specifically, I believe that we must direct our thought and efforts to many, many fields; and I don't have a great staff and little I can contribute in the way of leadership, but if I can leave the thought with those of you who do make up a great staff and who serve as my staff, I want to suggest a few little relatively unimportant thoughts as just some of the things to be put on your agenda. Are the federal government, the state government, the foundation and the churches, the university is doing what they can and all that they should to assure enough Black scholarships for young Blacks in every field? The answer is no. Very little.\n","It gets back to the same thing. Herman Sweatt can come to this university now, but as someone said on the panel this morning, Henry Gonzalez, I think, \"What good is he doing sitting at the counter to get a cup of coffee if he doesn't have 50 cents to get it?\" And most of them just don't have it. That’s why they are not here. It's not their mother or their father who didn’t want them here. It's not that they don't have an ambition to be here. They just can’t do it and we’ve got to level out that ground son.\n","Or are professions such as law and medicine, accounting and engineering, and dentistry and architecture taking the initiative? Sounding the call to make certain that their educational programs are so planned and so conducted that Blacks are being prepared for the leadership courses and are being given the support that they must have if they are to complete the courses and to have genuine opportunities to establish themselves in positions of leadership, professional careers, and things of that matter after their college days.\n","Or are trade unions and all those concerned with vocational occupation doing the same to open up apprenticeships and training programs so that the Blacks, the group I spoke of, have a fair chance of entering and a fair chance of succeeding in these fields that are so vital to the future of our nation and to our country at this very moment?\n","Are our employers who have already made a start toward opening jobs to the Blacks doing what they can and should in order to make certain that Blacks qualify for advancement on the promotion ladder, and that the promotion ladder itself reaches out for the Blacks as it does for the others in our society?\n","What I’m saying is that we cannot take care of the goals to which we have committed ourselves simply by adopting a Black \"star system.\" It is good and it is heartening and it is satisfying to see individual Blacks succeeding as stars in the field of politics, athletics, entertainment, and other activities where they have high visibility such as Clarence Mitchell referred to in his family. I felt almost as good in my own election -- not quite as good -- when Barbara and Yvonne were elected this year because I thought that we were moving forward and I enjoyed knowing of those elections about as much as I did in my own.\n","But we must not allow the visibility of a few to diminish the efforts to satisfy what is our real responsibility to the still unseen millions who are faced with that basic problem of being Black in a White society. So our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules and all Americans play against the same odds. Who among us would claim that that is true today? I feel this is the first work of any society which aspires to greatness, so let's be on with it. We know there is injustice. We know there is intolerance. We know there is discrimination and hate and suspicion, and we know there is division among us. But there is a larger truth. We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done.\n","And if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then, my fellow Americans, I am confident we shall overcome. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," it is the record of this work that we have been discussing the last two days which brought us here, that holds the most of myself within it. the essence of government lies with unceasing concern for the welfare and dignity, dignity and decency and innate integrity of life for every individual, wherever he is. --------------------------\n","586 \n","Original text: Mr. Chairman, delegates, friends, and my fellow Americans: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am deeply humbled by your confidence, and on behalf of my family here and gone, I accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States of America.\n","I thank Speaker Paul Ryan for that gracious welcome. You’re a true friend and a great American leader. But Paul knows the introduction I prefer is a little shorter. I’m a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\n","I’m new to this campaign, and honestly I never thought I’d be standing here. I thought I’d be spending this evening with my friends in the Indiana delegation.\n","Yet, there I was a few days ago in New York City with the man who won 37 states … faced 16 talented opponents and outlasted every one of them … and along the way brought millions of new voters into the Republican Party. He’s a man known for his large personality, his colorful style, and his charisma – and, well, I guess he was looking for someone to balance the ticket.\n","For those of you who don’t know me, which is most of you, I grew up on the front row of the American dream. My grandfather immigrated to this country, and I was raised in a small town in Southern Indiana in a big family with a cornfield in the backyard. Although we weren’t really a political family, the heroes of my youth were President John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n","When I was young, I watched my Mom and Dad build everything that matters – a family, a business, and a good name. I was raised to believe in hard work, faith and family. My Dad, Ed Pence, was a combat veteran in Korea who ran gas stations in our small town, and was a great father. If Dad were still with us, I have a feeling he would have enjoyed this moment … and probably been pretty surprised by it. But it’s my joy to tell you that my mother is here, still in shock over the news I called her with last week. Would you welcome my Mom, Nancy?\n","Growing up I actually started in politics in the other party, until I heard the voice and the ideals of the 40th President, and I signed on for the Reagan Revolution.\n","The best thing that ever happened to me – even counting tonight – is that 31 years ago, I married the girl of my dreams … a school teacher and artist. She’s everything to me. Let me introduce you to my wonderful wife, Karen Pence.\n","And regardless of any title I ever hold, the highest role I will ever play is Dad. Karen and I are blessed to be the parents of the three greatest kids in the world … a writer named Charlotte, a college student named Audrey, and a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps, Michael J. Pence. Proud of you guys.\n","If you know anything about Hoosiers, you know we like to suit up and compete. We play to win. That is why I joined this campaign in a heartbeat. You have nominated a man for president who never quits, who never backs down — a fighter, and a winner. Until now, he has had to do it all by himself, against all odds. But this week, with this united party, come November 8, I know we will elect Donald Trump to be the 45th President of the United States of America.\n","We will win because we are running on the issues facing this country, and because we are leveling with the American people about the stakes and the choice. The American people are tired of being told. They’re tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. Tired of hearing politicians in both parties tell us that we will get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of debt on our children and grandchildren. As Ronald Reagan used to say, we’re tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plan them for ourselves.\n","In the end, this election comes down to just two names on the ballot; So let’s resolve here and now that Hillary Clinton will never become President of the United States of America. Hillary Clinton essentially offers a third Obama term. The role is perfect for her. She championed Obamacare because years earlier she had all but invented it. The national debt has nearly doubled in these eight years, and her only answer is to keep borrowing and spending. Like the president, she thinks that the path to a growing economy is more taxes and more regulation and more government.\n","They tell us this economy is the best that we can do. It’s nowhere near the best that we can do. It’s just the best that they can do. Let me tell you, I know firsthand, it dow not have to be like this. In my home state of Indiana, we prove every day that you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education and roads and healthcare.\n","You know, Indiana is a state that works because conservative principles work every time you put them into practice. The nation suffers under the weight of $19 trillion in national debt, we in Indiana have a $2 billion surplus. The highest credit rating in the nation, even though we’ve cut taxes every year since I became governor four years ago. We have fewer state employees than when I took office, and businesses large and small have created nearly 150,000 new jobs. That is what you can do with commonsense Republican leadership, and that is exactly what the no-nonsense leadership of Donald Trump will bring to the White House.\n","Donald Trump gets it. He’s the genuine article. He is a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers. When Donald Trump does his talking, he doesn’t tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness. He is his own man. Distinctly American. And where else would an independent spirit like that find a following than in the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n","The funny thing is, the party in power seems helpless to figure out the nominee. The media has the same problem. They all keep telling each other that the usual methods will work against him. They keep thinking that they’ve done him in, only to wake up the next morning and find that Donald Trump is still standing and stronger than ever before.\n","The man just doesn’t quit. He is tough. He perseveres. He has gone about as far as you can go in business, but he has never turned his back on the working men and women who serve and protect us at home and abroad.\n","It has been a heartbreaking time for the women and men in our law enforcement community. In this time of great testing for them, let’s let them know here and now, all across this country, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line of law enforcement in America.\n","Now, while Donald Trump was taking my measure as a possible running mate, I did some observing myself. I have seen the way he deals with people who work for him at every level. I’ve seen the way they feel about working for him. I grant you, he can be a little rough with politicians on stage, and I bet we see that again.\n","But I have seen this good man up close. His utter lack of pretense, his respect for the people who work for him, and his devotion to his family. If you still doubt what I’m saying, as we say back home, you can’t fake good kids. How about his amazing children? Aren’t they something? These are the true measures of our nominee. Chosen by the voters as the right man for these times. This is the outsider, my running mate — turned a longshot campaign into a movement.\n","Over in the other party, the idea was to present the exact opposite of a political outsider. The exact opposite of a calculating truth-teller. On that score, you have to hand it to the Democratic establishment — they outdid themselves this time.\n","At the very moment when America is crying out for something new and different, the other party has answered with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names. People in both parties are restless for change, ready to break free from old patterns in Washington, and Democrats are about to anoint someone who represents everything this country is tired of. You know, Hillary Clinton wants a better title. And I would too if I was already America’s secretary of the status quo.\n","The choice could not be more clear: Americans can elect someone who literally personifies the field establishment in Washington D.C., or we can choose a leader who will fight every day to make America great again. It is change versus status quo, and my fellow Republicans when Donald Trump becomes President of the United States, the change will be huge.\n","For years we have had fundamental problems in America that get talked to death in Washington D.C., but they never get solved. They even get worse. We’ve seen entire stretches of our country the written off by bad economic policies in ways that are deeply unfair. We see relentless mandates from the executive branch. It seems like no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise, and no provision of the Constitution is too large for them to ignore.\n","Meanwhile, we have seen borders that go unrespected, A military that has been diminished, promise after ringing promise to our veterans promptly forgotten. Then Donald Trump came along and started saying what practically everybody was thinking anyway, that our leaders need to be stronger. Under Donald Trump, our deals will be stronger. Under Donald Trump, our deals will be smarter, our soldiers will have what they need, and our veterans will have what they earned.\n","The good news is that it will not be nearly enough. Not against a candidate who captures the attention of the country the way Donald Trump has. Issue by issue, he and I will take our case to the voters. Pointing out the failures of the Obama/Clinton agenda and showing a better way, we will win the hearts and minds of the American people with an agenda for a stronger and more prosperous America.\n","Now, Washington D.C. thinks it’s only a narrow range of voters who will give Donald Trump a serious look, but I can tell you firsthand, there are a lot of Americans who feel like Democratic politicians taking them for granted. It is union members who don’t want a president who promises to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Those miners want an American energy policy, and they know that Donald Trump digs coal.\n","It is African-Americans who remember generations of hollow promises about safe streets and better schools, and they know Donald Trump will fight for equal opportunity, and he loves educational choice. It is Hispanic Americans who respect the law, who want jobs and opportunities for their families, who know that Donald Trump will uphold the law and get this economy moving for every American.\n","You know, the party of Lincoln was founded on equality and opportunity. During these difficult days, it will be our party in our agenda opens the doors for every American to succeed and prosper in this land. In so many ways, the Democratic Party has abandoned those and used to protect. Maybe they’ve become too entrenched in power. So comfortable at times but they lose patience with the normal legislative process. It’s so much simpler to impose their values by executive order or court action, and make no mistake about it: Hillary Clinton has big ideas along those lines.\n","As this election approaches, every American should know that while we are filling the presidency for the next four years, this election will define the Supreme Court for the next 40. We all had better think very, very carefully about what this means for our Constitution and limited government. Elect Hillary Clinton, and you better get used to being subject to unelected judges, using unaccountable power to take unconstitutional actions.\n","For the sake of the rule of law, for the sake of the sanctity of life, for the sake of our Second Amendment, and for the sake of all our other God-given liberties, we must ensure that the next president appointing justices to the Supreme Court is Donald Trump.\n","And Hillary Clinton’s record on foreign affairs is even worse. It was Hillary Clinton who helped undo all the games of the troops urge. A staggering failure of judgment that set ice is loose. It was Hillary Clinton who instigated the president’s disastrous agreement with the radical people of their own. It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harms way in Benghazi. Then she said, “What difference at this point does it make?”\n","As the proud father of a United States Marine, let me say for my heart: Anyone who said that, anyone who did that should be disqualified from ever serving as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the United States of America.\n","Seven and a half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton’s policies have weekend Americas place in the world. Terrorist attacks at home and abroad, grim and heartbreaking scenes from France just a few weeks ago, and the attempted coup in Turkey all attest to a world spinning apart. History teaches that weakness arouses evil. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s foreign-policy of leading from behind, moving red lines, feigning resets with Russia, and the rise, rule, and reign of ISIS are a testament to the truth of history.\n","We cannot have four more years apologizing to her enemies and abandoning our friends. America needs to be strong for the world to be safe, and on the world stage, Donald Trump will lead from strength.\n","Donald Trump will rebuild our military and stand with our allies. Donald Trump will confront radical Islamic terrorism at its source and destroy the enemy of our freedom. If the world does nothing else, it will notice: America stands with Israel.\n","If you looked at the calendar this morning, you may have noticed, the presidency of Barack Obama ends exactly six months from today. This much is certain of the Obama years: They are not ending well. There seem to be so many things that divide us, so few great purposes that Unitas as they once did. It is at moments like this, moments when politics fail, but I believe we do well to remember what unites us far exceeds anything that sets us apart in America. That we are, as we have always been, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n","Should I have the awesome privilege to serve as your vice president, I promise to keep faith with that conviction, to pray daily for a wise and discerning heart, for who is able to govern this great people without it?\n","My fellow Americans, I believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny and I have faith, faith in the boundless capacities of the American people, and faith that God can still heal our land.\n","But we have a choice to make. This is another time for choosing. If you want a president who will protect this nation, confront radical Islamic terrorism, and rid the world of ISIS; if you want a president who will restore lawn order to this country and give lawn force meant the support and resources they deserve; if you want a president who will cut taxes grow our economy and squeeze every nickel out of the federal bureaucracy; if you want to President will build strong borders and enforce our laws, and if you want to president who will upend the status quo in Washington D.C. and a point justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution; we have but one choice and that man is ready, this team is ready, our party is ready, and when we elect Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States, together we will make America great again.\n","Now let’s go get this done!\n","Thank you and God bless you and God bless the United States of America. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," delegates, friends, and my fellow Americans: thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am deeply humbled by your confidence and accept your nomination to run and serve as vice president of the united states of America. but Paul knows the introduction I prefer is a little shorter. --------------------------\n","587 \n","Original text: I have just chaired a meeting of the Cabinet, where we agreed that the Government should call a general election, to be held on the 8th of June. I want to explain the reasons for that decision, what will happen next and the choice facing the British people when you come to vote in this election.\n","Last summer, after the country voted to leave the European Union, Britain needed certainty, stability, and strong leadership; and since I became Prime Minister the Government has delivered precisely that. Despite predictions of immediate financial and economic danger, since the referendum we have seen consumer confidence remain high, record numbers of jobs, and economic growth that has exceeded all expectations. We have also delivered on the mandate that we were handed by the referendum result. Britain is leaving the European Union and there can be no turning back.\n","And as we look to the future, the Government has the right plan for negotiating our new relationship with Europe. We want a deep and special partnership between a strong and successful European Union and a United Kingdom that is free to chart its own way in the world. That means we will regain control of our own money, our own laws, and our own borders; and we will be free to strike trade deals with old friends and new partners all around the world.\n","This is the right approach, and it is in the national interest. But the other political parties oppose it. At this moment of enormous national significance, there should be unity here in Westminster, but instead there is division. The country is coming together, but Westminster is not.\n","In recent weeks Labour have threatened to vote against the final agreement we reach with the European Union. The Liberal Democrats have said they want to grind the business of Government to a standstill. The Scottish National Party say they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals Britain’s membership of the European Union. And unelected members of the House of Lords have vowed to fight us every step of the way.\n","Our opponents believe, because the Government’s majority is so small, that our resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course. They are wrong. They under-estimate our determination to get the job done and I am not prepared to let them endanger the security of millions of working people across the country -- because what they are doing jeopardizes the work we must do to prepare for Brexit at home, and it weakens the Government’s negotiating position in Europe.\n","If we do not hold a general election now their political game-playing will continue, and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election. Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country. So we need a general election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin.\n","I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion.\n","Since I became Prime Minister I have said that there should be no election until 2020, but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take. And so tomorrow I will move a motion in the House of Commons calling for a general election to be held on the 8th of June.\n","That motion, as set out by the Fixed-Term Parliament[s] Act, will require a two-thirds majority of the House of Commons. So I have a simple challenge to the opposition parties: You have criticized the Government’s vision for Brexit; you have challenged our objectives; you have threatened to block the legislation we put before Parliament. This is your moment to show you mean it, to show you are not opposing the Government for the sake of it, to show that you do not treat politics as a game.\n","Let us tomorrow vote for an election. Let us put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programs for Government. And then, let the people decide. And the decision facing the country will be all about leadership.\n","It will be a choice between strong and stable leadership in the national interest, with me as your Prime Minister, or weak and unstable coalition Government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, propped up by the Liberal Democrats, who want to reopen the divisions of the referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP.\n","Every vote for the Conservatives will make it harder for opposition politicians who want to stop me from getting the job done.\n","Every vote for the Conservatives will make me stronger when I negotiate for Britain with the Prime Ministers, Presidents, and Chancellors of the European Union.\n","Every vote for the Conservatives will mean we can stick to our plan for a stronger Britain and take the right long-term decisions for a more secure future.\n","It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond.\n","So, tomorrow, let the House of Commons vote for an election.\n","Let everybody put forward their proposals for Brexit and their programs for Government.\n","And let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability and continue to give the country the strong and stable leadership it demands.\n","Thank you.\n","Page Updated: 9/24/17 \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the government has the right plan for negotiating our new relationship with Europe. at this moment of enormous national significance, there should be unity here in Westminster, but instead there is division. --------------------------\n","588 \n","Original text: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n","Mr. Chairmen, Ranking Members, Members of the Committees, thank you for the opportunity to provide my assessment of the security situation in Iraq and to discuss the recommendations I recently provided to my chain of command for the way forward.\n","At the outset, I would like to note that this is my testimony. Although I have briefed my assessment and recommendations to my chain of command, I wrote this testimony myself. It has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or the Congress until it was just handed out.\n","As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met. In recent months, in the face of tough enemies and the brutal summer heat of Iraq, Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces have achieved progress in the security arena. Though the improvements have been uneven across Iraq, the overall number of security incidents in Iraq has declined in 8 of the past 12 weeks, with the number of incidents in the last two weeks at the lowest levels seen since June 2006.\n","One reason for the decline in incidents is that Coalition and Iraqi forces have dealt significant blows to Al Qaeda-Iraq. Though Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Iraq remain dangerous, we have taken away a number of their sanctuaries and gained the initiative in many areas.\n","We have also disrupted Shia militia extremists, capturing the head and numerous other leaders of the Iranian-supported Special Groups, along with a senior Lebanese Hezbollah operative supporting Iran’s activities in Iraq.\n","Coalition and Iraqi operations have helped reduce ethno-sectarian violence, as well, bringing down the number of ethno-sectarian deaths substantially in Baghdad and across Iraq since the height of the sectarian violence last December. The number of overall civilian deaths has also declined during this period, although the numbers in each area are still at troubling levels.\n","Iraqi Security Forces have also continued to grow and to shoulder more of the load, albeit slowly and amid continuing concerns about the sectarian tendencies of some elements in their ranks. In general, however, Iraqi elements have been standing and fighting and sustaining tough losses, and they have taken the lead in operations in many areas.\n","Additionally, in what may be the most significant development of the past 8 months, the tribal rejection of Al Qaeda that started in Anbar Province and helped produce such significant change there has now spread to a number of other locations as well.\n","Based on all this and on the further progress we believe we can achieve over the next few months, I believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre-surge level of brigade combat teams by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains that we have fought so hard to achieve.\n","Beyond that, while noting that the situation in Iraq remains complex, difficult, and sometimes downright frustrating, I also believe that it is possible to achieve our objectives in Iraq over time, although doing so will be neither quick nor easy.\n","Having provided that summary, I would like to review the nature of the conflict in Iraq, recall the situation before the surge, describe the current situation, and explain the recommendations I have provided to my chain of command for the way ahead in Iraq.\n","The fundamental source of the conflict in Iraq is competition among ethnic and sectarian communities for power and resources. This competition will take place, and its resolution is key to producing long-term stability in the new Iraq. The question is whether the competition takes place more -- or less -- violently. This chart shows the security challenges in Iraq.\n","This chart shows the security challenges in Iraq. Foreign and home-grown terrorists, insurgents, militia extremists, and criminals all push the ethno-sectarian competition toward violence. Malign actions by Syria and, especially, by Iran fuel that violence. Lack of adequate governmental capacity, lingering sectarian mistrust, and various forms of corruption add to Iraq’s challenges.\n","In our recent efforts to look to the future, we found it useful to revisit the past. In December 2006, during the height of the ethno-sectarian violence that escalated in the wake of the bombing of the Golden Dome Mosque in Samarra, the leaders in Iraq at that time -- General George Casey and Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad -- concluded that the coalition was failing to achieve its objectives. Their review underscored the need to protect the population and reduce sectarian violence, especially in Baghdad. As a result, General Casey requested additional forces to enable the Coalition to accomplish these tasks, and those forces began to flow in January.\n","In the ensuing months, our forces and our Iraqi counterparts have focused on improving security, especially in Baghdad and the areas around it, wresting sanctuaries from Al Qaeda control, and disrupting the efforts of the Iranian-supported militia extremists. We have employed counterinsurgency practices that underscore the importance of units living among the people they are securing, and accordingly, our forces have established dozens of joint security stations and patrol bases manned by Coalition and Iraqi forces in Baghdad and in other areas across Iraq.\n","In mid-June, with all the surge brigades in place, we launched a series of offensive operations focused on: expanding the gains achieved in the preceding months in Anbar Province; clearing Baqubah, several key Baghdad neighborhoods, the remaining sanctuaries in Anbar Province, and important areas in the so-called “belts” around Baghdad; and pursuing Al Qaeda in the Diyala River Valley and several other areas.\n","Throughout this period, as well, we engaged in dialogue with insurgent groups and tribes, and this led to additional elements standing up to oppose Al Qaeda and other extremists. We also continued to emphasize the development of the Iraqi Security Forces and we employed non-kinetic means to exploit the opportunities provided by the conduct of our kinetic combat operations -- aided in this effort by the arrival of additional Provincial Reconstruction Teams.\n","The progress our forces have achieved with our Iraqi counterparts has, as I noted at the outset, been substantial. While there have been setbacks as well as successes and tough losses along the way, overall, our tactical commanders and I see improvements in the security environment. We do not, however, just rely on gut feel or personal observations; we also conduct considerable data collection and analysis to gauge progress and determine trends.\n","We do this by gathering and refining data from coalition and Iraqi operations centers, using a methodology that has been in place for well over a year and that has benefited over the past seven months from the increased presence of our forces living among the Iraqi people. We endeavor to ensure our analysis of that data is conducted with rigor and consistency, as our ability to achieve a nuanced understanding of the security environment is dependent on collecting and analyzing data in a consistent way over time. Two US intelligence agencies recently reviewed our methodology, and they concluded that the data we produce is the most accurate and authoritative in Iraq.\n","As I mentioned up front, and as the chart before you reflects, the level of security incidents has decreased significantly since the start of the surge of offensive operations in mid-June, declining in 8 of the past 12 weeks, with the level of incidents in the past two weeks the lowest since June 2006 and with the number of attacks this past week the lowest since April 2006. Civilian deaths of all categories, less natural causes, have also declined considerably, by over 45% Iraq-wide since the height of the sectarian violence in December.\n","This is shown by the top line on this chart, and the decline by some 70% in Baghdad is shown by the bottom line. Periodic mass casualty attacks by Al Qaeda have tragically added to the numbers outside Baghdad, in particular. Even without the sensational attacks, however, the level of civilian deaths is clearly still too high and continues to be of serious concern.\n","As the next chart shows, the number of ethno-sectarian deaths, an important subset of the overall civilian casualty figures, has also declined significantly since the height of the sectarian violence in December. Iraq-wide, as shown by the top line on this chart, the number of ethno-sectarian deaths has come down by over 55%, and it would have come down much further were it not for the casualties inflicted by barbaric Al Qaeda bombings attempting to reignite sectarian violence. In Baghdad, as the bottom line shows, the number of ethno-sectarian deaths has come down by some 80% since December. This chart also displays the density of sectarian incidents in various Baghdad neighborhoods and it both reflects the progress made in reducing ethno-sectarian violence in the Iraqi capital and identifies the areas that remain the most challenging.\n","As we have gone on the offensive in former Al Qaeda and insurgent sanctuaries, and as locals have increasingly supported our efforts, we have found a substantially increased number of arms, ammunition, and explosives caches.\n","As this chart shows, we have, so far this year, already found and cleared over 4,400 caches, nearly 1,700 more than we discovered in all of last year.\n","This may be a factor in the reduction in the number of overall improvised explosive device attacks in recent months, which as this chart shows, has declined sharply, by about one-third, since June.\n","The change in the security situation in Anbar Province has, of course, been particularly dramatic.\n","As this chart shows, monthly attack levels in Anbar have declined from some 1,350 in October 2006 to a bit over 200 in August of this year. This dramatic decrease reflects the significance of the local rejection of Al Qaeda and the newfound willingness of local Anbaris to volunteer to serve in the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police Service. As I noted earlier, we are seeing similar actions in other locations, as well.\n","To be sure, trends have not been uniformly positive across Iraq, as is shown by this chart depicting violence levels in several key Iraqi provinces. The trend in Ninevah Province, for example, has been much more up and down, until a recent decline, and the same is true in Sala ad Din Province -- Sadaam’s former home province -- though recent trends there and in Baghdad have been in the right direction recently. In any event, the overall trajectory in Iraq -- a steady decline of incidents in the past three months -- is still quite significant.\n","The number of car bombings and suicide attacks has also declined in each of the past 5 months, from a high of some 175 in March, as this chart shows, to about 90 this past month. While this trend in recent months has been heartening, the number of high profile attacks is still too high, and we continue to work hard to destroy the networks that carry out these barbaric attacks.\n","Our operations have, in fact, produced substantial progress against Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Iraq. As this chart shows, in the past 8 months, we have considerably reduced the areas in which Al Qaeda enjoyed sanctuary. We have also neutralized 5 media cells, detained the senior Iraqi leader of Al Qaeda-Iraq, and killed or captured nearly 100 other key leaders and some 2,500 rank-and-file fighters. Al Qaeda is certainly not defeated; however, it is off balance and we are pursuing its leaders and operators aggressively. Of note, as the recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq explained, these gains against Al Qaeda are a result of the synergy of actions by: conventional forces to deny the terrorists sanctuary; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to find the enemy; and special operations elements to conduct targeted raids. A combination of these assets is necessary to prevent the creation of a terrorist safe haven in Iraq.\n","In the past six months we have also targeted Shia militia extremists, capturing a number of senior leaders and fighters, as well as the deputy commander of Lebanese Hezbollah Department 2800, the organization created to support the training, arming, funding, and, in some cases, direction of the militia extremists by the Iranian Republican Guard Corps’ Quds Force. These elements have assassinated and kidnapped Iraqi governmental leaders, killed and wounded our soldiers with advanced explosive devices provided by Iran, and indiscriminately rocketed civilians in the International Zone and elsewhere. It is increasingly apparent to both Coalition and Iraqi leaders that Iran, through the use of the Quds Force, seeks to turn the Iraqi Special Groups into a Hezbollah-like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and coalition forces in Iraq.\n","The most significant development in the past six months likely has been the increasing emergence of tribes --\n","The most significant development in the past six months likely has been the increasing emergence of tribes and local citizens rejecting Al Qaeda and other extremists. This has, of course, been most visible in Anbar Province. A year ago the province was assessed as “lost” politically. Today, it is a model of what happens when local leaders and citizens decide to oppose Al Qaeda and reject its Taliban-like ideology. While Anbar is unique and the model it provides cannot be replicated everywhere in Iraq, it does demonstrate the dramatic change in security that is possible with the support and participation of local citizens.\n","As this chart shows, other tribes have been inspired by the actions of those in Anbar and have volunteered to fight extremists as well. We have, in coordination with the Iraqi government’s National Reconciliation Committee, been engaging these tribes and groups of local citizens who want to oppose extremists and to contribute to local security. Some 20,000 such individuals are already being hired for the Iraqi Police, thousands of others are being assimilated into the Iraqi Army, and thousands more are vying for a spot in Iraq’s Security Forces.\n","As I noted earlier, Iraqi Security Forces have continued to grow, to develop their capabilities, and to shoulder more of the burdens of providing security for their country. Despite concerns about sectarian influence, inadequate logistics and supporting institutions, and an insufficient number of qualified commissioned and non-commissioned officers, Iraqi units are engaged around the country.\n","As this chart shows, there are now nearly 140 Iraqi Army, National Police, and Special Operations Forces Battalions in the fight, with about 95 of those capable of taking the lead in operations, albeit with some coalition support. Beyond that, all of Iraq’s battalions have been heavily involved in combat operations that often result in the loss of leaders, soldiers, and equipment. These losses are among the shortcomings identified by operational readiness assessments, but we should not take from these assessments the impression that Iraqi forces are not in the fight and contributing. Indeed, despite their shortages, many Iraqi units across Iraq now operate with minimal coalition assistance.\n","As counterinsurgency operations require substantial numbers of boots on the ground, we are helping the Iraqis expand the size of their security forces. Currently, there are some 445,000 individuals on the payrolls of Iraq’s Interior and Defense Ministries. Based on recent decisions by Prime Minister Maliki, the number of Iraq’s security forces will grow further by the end of the year, possibly by as much as 40,000. Given the security challenges Iraq faces, we support this decision, and we will work with the two security ministries as they continue their efforts to expand their basic training capacity, leader development programs, logistical structures and elements, and various other institutional capabilities to support the substantial growth in Iraqi forces.\n","Significantly, in 2007, Iraq will, as in 2006, spend more on its security forces than it will receive in security assistance from the United States. In fact, Iraq is becoming one of the United States’ larger foreign military sales customers, committing some 1.6 billion dollars to FMS already, with the possibility of up to 1.8 billion more being committed before the end of this year. And I appreciate the attention that some members of Congress have recently given to speeding up the FMS process for Iraq.\n","To summarize, the security situation in Iraq is improving, and Iraqi elements are slowly taking on more of the responsibility for protecting their citizens. Innumerable challenges lie ahead; however, Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces have made progress toward achieving security. As a result, the United States will be in a position to reduce its forces in Iraq in the months ahead.\n","Two weeks ago I provided recommendations for the way ahead in Iraq to the members of my chain of command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The essence of the approach I recommended is captured in its title: “Security While Transitioning: From Leading to Partnering to Overwatch.” This approach seeks to build on the security improvements our troopers and our Iraqi counterparts have fought so hard to achieve in recent months. It reflects recognition of the importance of securing the population and the imperative of transitioning responsibilities to Iraqi institutions and Iraqi forces as quickly as possible, but without rushing to failure. It includes substantial support for the continuing development of Iraqi Security Forces. It also stresses the need to continue the counterinsurgency strategy that we have been employing, but with Iraqis gradually shouldering more of the load. And it highlights the importance of regional and diplomatic -- regional and global diplomatic approaches. Finally, in recognition of the fact that this war is not only being fought on the ground in Iraq but also in cyberspace, it also notes the need to contest the enemy’s growing use of that important medium to spread extremism.\n","The recommendations I provided were informed by operational and strategic considerations. The operational considerations include recognition that:\n","• military aspects of the surge have achieved progress and generated momentum;\n","• Iraqi Security Forces have continued to grow and have slowly been shouldering more of the security burdens in Iraq;\n","• a mission focus on either population security or transition alone will not be adequate to achieve our objectives;\n","• success against Al Qaeda-Iraq and Iranian-supported militia extremists requires conventional forces as well as special operations forces; and\n","• the security and local political situations will enable us to draw down the surge forces.\n","My recommendations also took into account a number of strategic considerations:\n","• political progress will take place only if sufficient security exists;\n","• long-term US ground force viability will benefit from force reductions as the surge runs its course;\n","• regional, global, and cyberspace initiatives are critical to success; and\n","• Iraqi leaders understandably want to assume greater sovereignty in their country, although, as they recently announced, they do desire continued presence of coalition forces in Iraq in 2008 under a new UN Security Council Resolution and, following that, they want to negotiate a long term security agreement with the United States and other nations.\n","Based on these considerations, and having worked the battlefield geometry with Lieutenant General Ray Odierno, the multinational corps Iraq commander, to ensure that we retain and build on the gains for which our troopers have fought, I have recommended a drawdown of the surge forces from Iraq. In fact, later this month, the Marine Expeditionary Unit deployed as part of the surge will depart Iraq.\n","Beyond that, if my recommendations are approved, that unit’s departure will be followed by the withdrawal of a brigade combat team without replacement in mid-December and the further redeployment without replacement of four other brigade combat teams and the two surge Marine battalions in the first 7 months of 2008, until we reach the pre-surge levels of 15 brigade combat teams by mid-July 2008.\n","I would also like to discuss the period beyond next summer. Force reductions will continue beyond the pre-surge levels of brigade combat teams that we will reach by mid-July 2008; however, in my professional judgment, it would be premature to make recommendations on the pace of such reductions at this time. In fact, our experience in Iraq has repeatedly shown that projecting too far into the future is not just difficult, it can be misleading and even hazardous.\n","The events of the past six months underscore that point. When I testified in January, for example, no one would have dared to forecast that Anbar Province would have been transformed the way it has in the past 6 months. Nor would anyone have predicted that volunteers in one-time Al Qaeda strongholds like Ghazaliyah in western Baghdad or in Adamiya in eastern Baghdad would seek to join the fight against Al Qaeda. Nor would we have anticipated that a Shia-led government would accept significant numbers of Sunni Arab volunteers into the ranks of the local police force in Abu Ghraib. Beyond that, on a less encouraging note, none of us earlier this year appreciated the extent of Iranian involvement in Iraq, something about which we and Iraq’s leaders all now have greater concern.\n","In view of this, I do not believe it is reasonable to have an adequate appreciation for the pace of further reductions and mission adjustments beyond the summer of 2008 until about mid-March of next year. We will, no later than that time, consider factors similar to those on which I based the current recommendations, having by then, of course, a better feel for the security situation, the improvements in the capabilities of our Iraqi counterparts, and the enemy situation. I will then, as I did in developing the recommendations I have explained here today, also take into consideration the demands on our Nation’s ground forces, although I believe that that consideration should once again inform, not drive, the recommendations I make.\n","This chart captures the recommendations I have described, showing the recommended reduction of brigade combat teams as the surge runs its course and illustrating the concept of our units adjusting their missions and transitioning responsibilities to Iraqis, as the situation and Iraqi capabilities permit. It also reflects the no-later-than date for recommendations on force adjustments beyond next summer and provides a possible approach we have considered for the future force structure and mission set in Iraq.\n","One may argue that the best way to speed the process in Iraq is to change the MNF-I mission from one that emphasizes population security, counter-terrorism, and transition, to one that is strictly focused on transition and counter-terrorism. Making that change now would, in our view, be premature. We have learned before that there is a real danger in handing over tasks to the Iraqi Security Forces before their capacity and local conditions warrant. In fact, the drafters of the recently released National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq recognized this danger when they wrote, and I quote, “We assess that changing the mission of Coalition forces from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization role to a primary counter combat support role for Iraqi forces and counterterrorist operations to prevent Al Qaeda Iraq from establishing a safe haven would erode security gains achieved thus far.”\n","In describing the recommendations I have made, I should note again that, like Ambassador Crocker, I believe Iraq’s problems will require a long-term effort. There are no easy answers or quick solutions. And although we both believe this effort can succeed, it will take time. Our assessments underscore, in fact, the importance of recognizing that a premature drawdown of our forces would likely have devastating consequences.\n","That assessment is supported by the findings of a 16 August Defense Intelligence Agency report on the implications of a rapid withdrawal of US forces from Iraq. Summarizing it in an unclassified fashion, it concludes that a rapid withdrawal would result in the further release of the strong centrifugal forces in Iraq and produce a number of dangerous results, including a high risk of disintegration of the Iraqi Security Forces; rapid deterioration of local security initiatives; Al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lost ground and freedom of maneuver; a marked increase in violence and further ethno-sectarian displacement and refugee flows; alliances of convenience by Iraqi groups with internal and external forces to gain advantages over their rivals; and exacerbation of already challenging regional dynamics, especially with respect to Iran.\n","Lieutenant General Odierno and I share this assessment and believe that the best way to secure our national interests and to avoid an unfavorable outcome in Iraq is to continue to focus our operations on securing the Iraqi people while targeting terrorist groups and militia extremists and, as quickly as conditions are met, transitioning security tasks to Iraqi elements.\n","Before closing, I want to thank you and your colleagues for your support of our men and women in uniform in Iraq. The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen with whom I’m honored to serve are the best equipped and, very likely, the most professional force in our nation’s history. Impressively, despite all that has been asked of them in recent years, they continue to raise their right hands and volunteer to stay in uniform. With three weeks to go in this fiscal year, in fact, the Army elements in Iraq, at multinational corps Iraq for example, have achieved well over 130% of the reenlistment goals in the initial term and careerist categories and nearly 115% in the mid-career category. All of us appreciate what you have done to ensure that these great troopers have had what they’ve needed to accomplish their mission, just as we appreciate what you have done to take care of their families, as they, too, have made significant sacrifices in recent years.\n","The advances you have underwritten in weapons systems and individual equipment; in munitions; in command, control, and communications systems; in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; in vehicles and counter-IED systems and programs; and in manned and unmanned aircraft have proved invaluable in Iraq. The capabilities that you have funded most recently -- especially the vehicles that will provide greater protection against improvised explosive devices -- are also of enormous importance. Additionally, your funding of the Commander’s Emergency Response Program has given our leaders a critical tool with which to prosecute the counterinsurgency campaign. Finally, we appreciate as well your funding of our new detention programs and rule of law initiatives in Iraq.\n","In closing, it remains an enormous privilege to soldier again in Iraq with America’s new “Greatest Generation.” Our country’s men and women in uniform have done a magnificent job in the most complex and challenging environment imaginable. All Americans should be very proud of their sons and daughters serving in Iraq today.\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," in recent months, coalition and Iraqi security forces have achieved progress in the security arena. the overall number of security incidents in Iraq has declined in 8 of the past 12 weeks, with the number at the lowest levels seen since June 2006. a reason for the decline in incidents is that coalition has dealt significant blows to al Qaeda-Iraq. --------------------------\n","589 \n","Original text: We are pleased today to announce an important step forward in our nation’s ongoing fight against the organized crime families of La Cosa Nostra -- the mafia.\n","Today, more than 800 federal, state, and local law enforcement officials have arrested over 110 individuals, including dozens of La Cosa Nostra members and associates -- one in Italy. In total, 127 people have been charged in 16 indictments unsealed today in four districts in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.\n","This is one of the largest single-day operations against the mafia in the FBI’s history, both in terms of the number of defendants arrested and charged, and the scope of the criminal activity that is alleged. Defendants from numerous La Cosa Nostra families have been charged, including defendants from all five New York-based families: the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Luchese families.\n","We have charged mob associates and mob bosses alike, including the former boss of La Cosa Nostra operations in New England; the Street Boss, Acting Underboss, and Consigliere of the Colombo family; and the Gambino family Consigliere and a member of that family’s ruling panel.\n","Their alleged crimes include numerous violent and illegal acts -- from murder and narcotics trafficking to extortion, illegal gambling, arson, loan sharking, and labor racketeering.\n","Now, some allegations involve classic mob hits to eliminate perceived rivals. Others involve truly senseless murders. In one instance, a victim was allegedly shot and killed during a botched robbery attempt. And two other murder victims allegedly were shot in a public bar because of a dispute over a spilled drink.\n","Other charged criminal activity reflects the mafia’s continued influence in various economic sectors and its alleged schemes to steal money by preying on vulnerable Americans. One fraud scheme carried out by the Colombo crime family allegedly defrauded consumers with poor credit histories out of one-time payments that the consumers believed they were making to secure loans. Other charges allege that the crime families extorted money from various labor union members, including local -- local chapters, local unions of International Longshoremen’s Association, and a concrete union here in New York.\n","Now, today’s arrests mark an important and encouraging step forward in disrupting La Cosa Nostra’s operations. But the reality is that our battle against organized crime enterprises is far from over. This is an ongoing effort and it must, and will, remain a top priority for all of us in law enforcement. Members and associates of La Cosa Nostra are among the most dangerous criminals in our country. The very oath of allegiance sworn by these mafia members during their initiation ceremony binds them to a life of crime.\n","Now, as we’ve seen for decades criminal mafia operations can negatively impact our economy -- not only through a wide variety of fraud schemes but also through the illegal imposition of what in essence are mob “taxes” at our ports, in our construction industries, and on our small businesses. In some cases, La Cosa Nostra members and associates allegedly seek to corrupt legitimate businesses and those who have sworn to uphold the public trust. And many of them are lethal. Time and again, they have shown a willingness to kill -- to make money, to eliminate rivals, and to silence witnesses.\n","Now, today’s successful arrests -- across multiple cities and involving multiple mafia families -- sends a clear message that, in our fight against organized crime, the Justice Department is targeting federal resources and working with our state and local law enforcement partners like never before. We are committed and we are determined to eradicate these criminal enterprises once [and] for all and to bring their members to justice.\n","Now, as part of our commitment to battling organized crime, the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, headed by Lanny Breuer, has announced that it is working to merge its historic Organized Crime and Racketeering Section with its Gang Unit -- a move that will bring together an elite group of prosecutors with extensive knowledge and experience in combating criminal enterprises.\n","In addition, due to the continued threat that these criminal organizations pose, in September of last year I issued an order directing the Department’s Criminal Division, the United States Attorneys’ Offices, and the FBI to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to effectively combat these domestic organized crime groups, as well as international criminal organizations that threaten our nation’s security.\n","I want to thank my colleagues in the Criminal Division, in the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and in the FBI for their outstanding efforts -- and their commitment to collaboration.\n","Today’s actions are a reflection and a direct result of that renewed commitment. I am grateful to and proud of all of the investigators, the prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and our agency partners who were involved in today’s take-downs. This investigation and these prosecutions reflect unprecedented collaboration among four United States Attorneys Offices, the Department’s Criminal Division, and the FBI.\n","I want to hank you all, and congratulations on a job very well done. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," more than 800 federal, state, and local law enforcement officials have arrested over 110 individuals. in total, 127 people have been charged in 16 indictments unsealed today in four districts in new york, new jersey, or Rhode Island. this is one of the largest single-day operations against the mafia in the FBI’s history. --------------------------\n","590 \n","Original text: Statement on the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy to USHOR Committee on Financial Services\n","Thank you, Chairman [Spencer] Bachus, Ranking Member [Barney] Frank, and other Members of the Committee. I'm pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to the Congress. Let me begin the discussion of current economic conditions, and the outlook, and then I'll talk about monetary policy.\n","The U.S. economy has continued to recover, but economic activity appears to have decelerated somewhat during the first half of the year. After rising at an annual rate of 2 and a half percent in the second half of 2011, real GDP [Gross Domestic Product] increased at a 2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2012, and available indicators point to a still-smaller gain in the second quarter.\n","Conditions in the labor market improved during the latter part of 2011 and early this year, with the unemployment rate falling about a percentage point over that period. However, after running at nearly 200,000 per month during the fourth and first quarters, the average increase in payroll employment shrank to 75,000 per month during the second quarter. Issues related to seasonal adjustment and the unusually warm weather this past winter can account for a part, but only a part, of this loss of momentum in job creation. At the same time, the jobless rate has recently leveled out at just over 8 percent.\n","Household spending has continued to advance, but recent data indicate a somewhat slower rate of growth in the second quarter. Although declines in energy prices are now providing some support to consumers' purchasing power, households remain concerned about their employment and income prospects and their overall level of confidence remains relatively low.\n","We have seen modest signs of improvement in housing. In part because of historically low mortgage rates, both new and existing home sales have been gradually trending upward since last summer, and some measures of house prices have turned up in recent months. Construction has increased, especially in the multifamily sector. Still, a number of factors continue to impede progress in the housing market. On the demand side, many would-be buyers are deterred by worries about their own finances or about the economy more generally. Other prospective homebuyers cannot obtain mortgages due to tight lending standards, impaired creditworthiness, or because their current mortgages are underwater -- that is, they owe more than their homes are worth. On the supply side, the large number of vacant homes, boosted by the ongoing inflow of foreclosed properties, continues to divert demand from new construction.\n","After posting strong gains over the second half of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, manufacturing production has slowed in recent months. Similarly, the rise in real business spending on equipment and software appears to have decelerated from the double-digit pace seen over the second half of 2011 to a more moderate rate of growth over the first part of this year. Forward-looking indicators of investment demand -- such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans -- suggest further weakness ahead. In part, slowing growth in production and capital investment appears to reflect economic stresses in Europe, which, together with some cooling in the economies of other trading partners, is restraining the demand for U.S. exports.\n","At the time of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), my colleagues and I projected that, under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, economic growth will likely continue at a moderate pace over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually. Specifically, our projections for growth in real GDP prepared for the meeting had a central tendency of 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent for this year and 2.2 percent to 2.8 percent for 2013. These forecasts are lower than those we made in January, reflecting the generally disappointing tone of the recent incoming data.\n","In addition, financial strains associated with the crisis in Europe have increased since earlier in the year, which -- as I already noted -- are weighing on both global and domestic economic activity. The recovery in the United States continues to be held back by a number of other headwinds, including still-tight borrowing conditions for some businesses and households, and -- as I will discuss in more detail shortly -- the restraining effects of fiscal policy and fiscal uncertainty. Moreover, although the housing market has shown improvement, the contribution of this sector to the recovery is less than has been typical of previous recoveries. These headwinds should fade over time, allowing the economy to grow somewhat more rapidly and the unemployment rate to decline toward a more normal level. However, given that growth is projected to be not much above the rate needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force, the reduction in the unemployment rate seems likely to be frustratingly slow. Indeed, the central tendency of participants' forecasts now has the unemployment rate at 7 percent or higher at the end of 2014. The Committee made comparatively small changes in June to its projections for inflation.\n","Over the first three months of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose about 3.5 percent at an annual rate, boosted by a large increase in retail energy prices that in turn reflected the higher cost of crude oil. However, the sharp drop in crude oil prices in the past few months has brought inflation down. In all, the PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 1.5 percent over the first five months of this year, compared with a 2.5 percent rise over 2011 as a whole. The central tendency of the Committee's projections is that inflation will be 1.2 percent to 1.7 percent this year, and at or below the 2 percent level that the Committee judges to be consistent with its statutory mandate in 2013 and 2014.\n","Participants at the June FOMC meeting indicated that they see a higher degree of uncertainty about their forecasts than normal and that the risks to economic growth have increased. I would like to highlight two main sources of risk: The first is the euro-area fiscal and banking crisis; the second is the U.S. fiscal situation.\n","Earlier this year, financial strains in the euro area moderated in response to a number of constructive steps by the European authorities, including the provision of three-year bank financing by the European Central Bank. However, tensions in euro-area financial markets intensified again more recently, reflecting political uncertainties in Greece and news of losses at Spanish banks, which in turn raised questions about Spain's fiscal position and the resilience of the euro-area banking system more broadly. Euro area authorities have responded by announcing a number of measures, including funding for the recapitalization of Spain's troubled banks, greater flexibility in the use of the European financial backstops (including, potentially, the flexibility to recapitalize banks directly rather than through loans to sovereigns), and movement toward unified supervision of euro-area banks. Even with these announcements, however, Europe's financial markets and economy remain under significant stress, with spillover effects on financial and economic conditions in the rest of the world, including the United States. Moreover, the possibility that the situation in Europe will worsen further remains a significant risk to the outlook.\n","The Federal Reserve remains in close communication with our European counterparts. Although the politics are complex, we believe that the European authorities have both strong incentives and sufficient resources to resolve the crisis. At the same time, we have been focusing on improving the resilience of our financial system to severe shocks, including those that might emanate from Europe. The capital and liquidity positions of U.S. banking institutions have improved substantially in recent years, and we have been working with U.S. financial firms to ensure they are taking steps to manage the risks associated with their exposures to Europe. That said, European developments that resulted in a significant disruption in global financial markets would inevitably pose significant challenges for our financial system and our economy.\n","The second important risk to our recovery, as I mentioned, is the domestic fiscal situation. As is well known, U.S. fiscal policies are on an unsustainable path, and the development of a credible medium-term plan for controlling deficits should be a high priority. At the same time, fiscal decisions should take into account the fragility of the recovery. That recovery could be endangered by the confluence of tax increases and spending reductions that will take effect early next year if no legislative action is taken.\n","The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, if the full range of tax increases and spending cuts were allowed to take effect -- a scenario widely referred to as the fiscal cliff -- a shallow recession would occur early next year and about 1.25m fewer jobs would be created in 2013. These estimates do not incorporate the additional negative effects likely to result from public uncertainty about how these matters will be resolved. As you recall, market volatility spiked and confidence fell last summer, in part as a result of the protracted debate about the necessary increase in the debt ceiling. Similar effects could ensue as the debt ceiling and other difficult fiscal issues come into clearer view toward the end of this year.\n","The most effective way that the Congress could help to support the economy right now would be to work to address the nation's fiscal challenges in a way that takes into account both the need for long-run sustainability and the fragility of the recovery. Doing so earlier rather than later would help reduce uncertainty and boost household and business confidence.\n","In view of the weaker economic outlook, subdued projected path for inflation, and significant downside risks to economic growth, the FOMC decided to ease monetary policy at its June meeting by continuing its maturity extension program (or MEP) through the end of this year. The MEP combines sales of short-term Treasury securities with an equivalent amount of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. As a result, it decreases the supply of longer-term Treasury securities available to the public, putting upward pressure on the prices of those securities and downward pressure on their yields, without affecting the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. By removing additional longer-term Treasury securities from the market, the Fed's asset purchases also induce private investors to acquire other longer-term assets, such as corporate bonds and mortgage backed-securities, helping to raise their prices and lower their yields and thereby making broader financial conditions more accommodative.\n","Economic growth is also being supported by the exceptionally low level of the target range for the federal funds rate of 0 percent to 0.25 percent and the Committee's forward guidance regarding the anticipated path of the funds rate. As I reported in my February testimony, the FOMC extended its forward guidance at its January meeting, noting that it expects that economic conditions -- including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run - are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee has maintained this conditional forward guidance at its subsequent meetings. Reflecting its concerns about the slow pace of progress in reducing unemployment and the downside risks to the economic outlook, the Committee made clear at its June meeting that it is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," economic activity appears to have decelerated somewhat during the first half of the year. real GDP [Gross Domestic Product] increased at a 2 percent pace in the second quarter of 2012, and available indicators point to an still-smaller gain in this year's first quarter. the unemployment rate has recently leveled out at just over 8 percent. --------------------------\n","591 \n","Original text: Thank you very much everybody and congratulations to the class of 2017.

Let me also extend our appreciation to the entire Falwell family: Tray, Sarah, Wesley, Laura and Caroline. Thank you for everything you do to make this university so exceptional, one of the truly great, great schools.\n","Most importantly, to our new graduates, each of you should take immense pride at what you have achieved.\n","There’s another group of amazing people we want to celebrate today and they are the ones who have made this journey possible for you. And you know who that is? Nobody -- You forgot already. You’re going to go out. You’re going to do whatever you’re going to do. Some are going to make a lot of money. Some are going to be even happier doing other things. They’re your parent and your grandparents. Don’t forget them. You haven’t forgotten yet, have you? Never ever forget them. They’re great. And especially this weekend. Let’s make sure we give a really extra special thanks to the moms. Don’t forget out moms ‘cause graduates, today is your day. Today is your day but in all of this excitement, don’t forget that tomorrow is Mother’s Day, right? I had a great mother. She’s looking down now. But I had a great mother. I always loved Mother’s Day.\n","We’re also deeply honored to be joined by some of the nearly 6,000 service members, military veterans and military spouses who are receiving their diplomas today. Would you please stand. Please stand. Wow. That’s great. Thank you very much. Great job. We’re profoundly grateful to every single one of you who sacrificed to keep us safe and to protect God’s precious gift of freedom. It is truly a testament to this university and to the values that you embrace that you’re graduating class includes so many patriots who have served our country in uniform. Thank you very much.\n","To the class of 2017, today you end one chapter, but you are about to begin the greatest adventure of your life. Just think for a moment of how blessed you are to be here today at this great, great university, living in this amazing country surrounded by people who you love and care about so much. Then ask yourself, with all of those blessings and all of the blessings that you’ve been given: What will you give back to this country and, indeed, to the world? What imprint will you leave in the sands of history? What will future Americans say we did in our brief time right here on Earth? Did we take risks? Did we dare to defy expectations? Did we challenge accepted wisdom and take on established systems? I think I did but we all did -- and we’re all doing it. Or did we just go along with convention -- swim downstream so easily with the current, and just give in because it was the easy way; it was the traditional way; or it was the accepted way?\n","Remember this: Nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy. Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage to do what is right. And they know what is right but they don’t have the courage or the guts or the stamina to take it and to do it. It’s called “The road less traveled.” I know that each of you will be a warrior for the truth, will be a warrior for our country and for your family. I know that each of you will do what is right, not what is the easy way, and that you will be true to yourself and your country and your beliefs.\n","In my short time in Washington, I’ve seen firsthand how the system is broken. A small group of failed voices, who think they know everything and understand everyone, want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think. But you aren’t going to let other people tell you what you believe. Especially when you know that you’re right. And those of you graduating here today who have given half a million hours of charity last year alone, unbelievable amount of work and charity, and few universities or colleges can claim anything even close, we don’t need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives. I’m standing here looking at the next generation of American leaders. There may very well be a president or two in our midst. Anybody think you’re going to president raise your hand.\n","In your hearts are inscribed the values of service, sacrifice, and devotion. Now, you must go forth into the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action. America has always been the land of dreams because America is a nation of true believers. When the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, they prayed. When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence, they invoked our creator four times. Because in America we don’t worship government, we worship God. That is why our elected officials put their hands on the Bible and say, “So help me God,” as they take the Oath of Office. It is why our currency proudly declares, “In God we trust.” And it’s why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation under God every time we say the Pledge of Allegiance. The story of America is the story of an adventure that began with deep faith, big dreams and humble beginnings.\n","That is also the story of Liberty University. When I think about the visionary founder of this great institution, Reverend Jerry Falwell Sr., I can only imagine how excited he would be if he could see all of these and all of you today, and how proud he would be of his son and of his family. In just two days, we will mark the 10th Anniversary of Reverend Falwell’s passing. I used to love watching him on television, hearing him preach. He was a very special man. He would be so proud, not just at what you’ve achieved, but of the young men and women of character that you’ve all become. And Jerry I know your dad is looking down on you right now and he is proud. He is very proud. So, congratulations on a great job Jerry.\n","Reverend Falwell’s life is a testament to the power of faith to change the world. The inspiring legacy that we see all around us in this great stadium, this is a beautiful stadium and it is packed. I’m so happy about that, I said, “How are you going to fill up a place like that?” It is packed, Jerry. In this beautiful campus and in your smiling faces. But it all began with a vision. That vision was of a world-class university for evangelical Christians. And I want to thank you because, boy, did you come out and vote, those of you that are all old enough, in other words, your parents. Boy, oh boy. You voted. You voted. No doubt many people told him his vision was impossible and I am sure they continued to say that so long after he started.\n","At the beginning, it was just 154 students. But the fact is no one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can’t be done. Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic because they are people that can’t get the job done. But the future belongs to the dreamers, not to the critics. The future belongs to the people who follow their heart no matter what the critic say because they truly believe in their vision. At Liberty, your leaders knew from the very beginning that a strong athletic program would help this campus grow so that this school might transform more lives. That is why a crucial part of Reverend Falwell’s vision for making Liberty a world-class institution was having a world-class football team, much like the great teams of Notre Dame, great school, great place. In fact, Vice President Mike Pence is there today doing a fabulous job as he always does.\n","A few years ago, the New York Times even wrote a story on the great ambitions of the Liberty Flames. That story prompted a long-time president of another school to write a letter to Jerry. It’s a letter that Reverend Falwell would have been very, very pleased to read. Jerry tells me that letter now hangs in the wall in the Boardroom of your great university. It came from the late Father Theodore Hesburgh, who is the beloved president of the University of Notre Dame 35 years ago. Like this school’s founder, he was a truly kind-hearted man of very, very deep faith. In the letter, Father Hesburgh recalled that Notre Dame’s own meteoric rise from a small Midwestern school to a national football powerhouse. And then he wrote something so amazing and generous. He wrote, “I think you are on that same trajectory now and I want to wish you all the best and encourage you from the starting and from being able to start very small and arriving in the big time.”\n","Thanks to hard work, great faith and incredible devotion, those dreams have come true. As of February of this year, the Liberty Flames are playing in the FBS, the highest level of competition in NCAA football. Don’t -- don’t clap. That could be tough. Don’t clap. That could be tough. I’m a little worried. I don’t want to look at some of the scores. Jerry, are you sure you know what you are doing here? Those other players are big and fast and strong. But I have a feeling you’re going to do very well, right?\n","From the most humble roots you’ve become a powerhouse in both education and sports. And just wait until the world hears the football teams you’ll be playing on your schedule starting next season. President Falwell gave me a list of some of those schools, the ones you’re going to be playing in 2018. Would you like me to read the names? It just came out. Would you like to hear ‘em? I’m a little bit concerned. UMass. Virginia. Auburn. Jerry, are you sure you know what you’re doing? Jerry, Auburn? I don’t know about that James. This -- this could be trouble, Jerry. Rutgers. Old Dominion. Brigham Young. Army. I might be at that game. Who am I supposed to route for, tell me? I don’t know. That’s a tough one, Jerry. Ah, I don’t know Jerry. I’m going to have to think about that one, Jerry. Buffalo. Troy. Virginia Tech. Oh, no, Jerry. Ole Miss and Wake Forest. Those are really top schools. That’s -- maybe in four or five years I’ll come to a game. Right? You’ll build it up first. Well, good luck.\n","The success of your athletic program, arriving on the big stage, should be a reminder to ever new graduate of just what you can achieve when you start small, pursue a big vision, and never ever quit. You never quit. If I give one message to hold in your hearts today, it’s this: “Never ever give up.” They’ll be times in your life you’ll want to quit. You’ll want to go home. You’ll want to go home perhaps to that wonderful mother that’s sitting back there watching you and say, “Mom, I can’t do it. I can’t do it.” Just never quit. Go back home and tell, “Mom, dad, I can do it. I can do it. I will do it.”\n","You’re going to be successful. I’ve seen so many brilliant people. They gave up in life. They were totally brilliant. They were top of their class. They were the best students. They were the best of everything. They gave up. I’ve seen others who really didn’t have talent or that ability and they are among the most successful people today in the world because they never quit and they never gave up. So just remember that. Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you. Carry yourself with dignity and pride. Demand the best from yourself and be totally unafraid to challenge entrenched interests and failed power structures. Does that sound familiar by the way?\n","The more people tell you it’s not possible, that it can’t be done, the more you should be absolutely determined to prove them wrong. Treat the word “impossible” as nothing more than motivation. Relish the opportunity to be an outsider. Embrace that label. Being an outsider is fine. Embrace the label. Because it’s the outsiders who change the world and will make a real and lasting difference. The more that a broken system tells you that you’re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead. You must keep pushing forward and always have the courage to be yourself. Most importantly, you have to do what you love. You have to do what you love. I’ve seen so many people, they’re forced through lots of reasons, sometimes including family, to go down a path that they don’t want to go down, to go down a path that leaves them to something that they don’t love, that they don’t enjoy. You have to do what you love or you most likely won’t be very successful at it. So do what you love.\n","I want to recognize a friend who is here with us today, who can serve as an inspiration to us all. Someone who doesn’t know the meaning of the word “quit.” A real champion. A true, true champion both on the field, off the field. He is a Hall of Fame quarter back for the Buffalo Bills, really a good friend of mind, an amazing guy. Jim Kelly. Where is Jim? He’s here someplace. Where is Jim? Stand up, Jim. What a great man. Jim Kelly. He was tough. Jim, do you have any idea how much money you’d be making today? They’ve hit Jim. It was like tackling a line backer. They’ve hit Jim, four guys, five guys that weighed 320, and he just keep going down the field. He was much more than a quarter back. He had tremendous heart and he knew how to win.\n","Jim is tough and his toughest fight of all was that he beat cancer, not once but twice. And I saw him and his incredible wife as they were in a very low moment, Jill. Very, very low moment. And it was amazing the way they fought. It didn’t look good. I would have said, “Maybe it’s not going to happen.” But there was always that hope because of Jim and Jim’s heart. But I want to just say it’s great to have you here today, Jim, and these people are big, big fans. And if you could get a young version of Jim Kelly, you’ll be beating a lot of teams, Jerry. So, interestingly, though. I said I wonder what Jim’s doing here. His daughter, Erin, crosses the goal line to you and today with you. So, Erin, stand up. Where are you, Erin? Where is Erin? Congratulations, Erin. Congratulations. Graduating from Liberty. Great choice. Thank you.\n","Liberty University is a place where they really have true champions. And you have a simple creed that you live by: To be really champions for Christ. Whether you are called to be a missionary overseas to shepherd a church or to be a leader in your community, you are a living witness of the Gospel message of faith, hope and love. And I must tell you I am so proud as your president to have helped you along over the past short period of time. I said I was going to do it and Jerry, I did it. And a lot of people are very happy with what’s taken place. Especially last week, we did some very important signings. Right, James? Very important signings.\n","America is better when people put their faith into action. As long as I am your president, no one is ever going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what’s in your heart. We will always stand up for the right of all Americans to pray to God and to follow his teachings. America is beginning a new chapter. Today, each of you begins a new chapter as well. When you’re story goes from here, it will be defined by your vision, your perseverance and your grit -- that’s a word Jim Kelly knows very well -- your grit.\n","In this, I am reminded of another man you know very well and who has joined us here today. His name is George Rogers, Liberty University CFO and vice president for a quarter of a century. During World War II, George spent three and a half years as a prisoner of war. He saw many of his fellow soldiers die during the Bataan Death March. He was the victim of starvation and torture as a prisoner of war. When he was finally set free, he weighed just 85 pounds and was told he would not live past the age of forty. Today, George is 98 years old. That’s so great, George. If anyone ever had reason to quit, to give in to the bitterness and anger that we all face at some point, to lose hope in God’s vision for his life, it was indeed George Rogers. But that’s not what he did. He stood up for his country. He stood up for his community. He stood up for his family and he defended civilization against a tide of barbarity.\n","The kind of barbarity we’re seeing today and we’ve been witnessing over the last number of years. And I just want to tell you as your President, we are doing very, very well in countering it. So, you just hang in there. Things are going along very, very well. You’ll be hearing a lot about it next week from our generals. Things are going along very, very well. Through it all, he kept his faith in God even in the darkest steps of despair.\n","Like so many others of his generation, George came home to a nation full of optimism and pride and began to live out the American dream. He started a family. He discovered God’s plan for him and pursued that vision with all his might, pouring his passion into a tiny college in a place called Lynchburg, Virginia. Did you ever hear of that, Lynchburg? We love -- really love it. Do you like it? Do we like it, right? I flew over it a little a while ago. It’s amazing, actually. What started as a dream with a few good friends, he helped shepherd into the largest Christian university in the world. Just look at this amazing, soaring, growing campus. And I’ve been watching it grow because I’ve been a friend of Liberty for a long time now, Jerry. It’s been a long time. Thanks in great part to George’s financial stewardship. Hundreds of thousands of young hearts and souls had been enriched at Liberty and inspired by the spirit of God. George, we thank you and we salute you, and you just stay healthy for a long time, George. Thank you.\n","Now it falls on the shoulders of each of you here today to protect the freedom that patriots like George earned with their incredible sacrifice. Fortunately, you have been equipped with the tools from your time right here on this campus to make the right decisions and to serve God, family and country. As you build good lives, you will also be rebuilding our nation. You’ll be leaders in your communities, stewards of great institutions and defenders of liberty. And you will be great mothers, and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers, loving friends, and loving family members. You will build a future where we have the courage to chase our dreams no matter what the cynics and the doubters have to say. You will have the confidence to speak the hopes in your hearts and to express the love that surge your souls. And you will have the faith to replace a broken establishment with a government that serves and protects the people.\n","We must always remember that we share one home and one glorious destiny. Whether we are brown, black or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all salute the same great American flag and we are all made by the same almighty God. As long as you remember what you have learned here at Liberty, as long as you have pride in your beliefs, courage in your convictions, and faith in your God, then you will not fail. And as long as America remains true to its values, loyal to its citizens, and devoted to its creator, then our best days are yet to come. I can promise you that.\n","This has been an exceptional morning. It’s been a great honor for me and I want to thank you, the students. I also want to thank you, the family, for getting them there. And I want to thank and congratulate Liberty. May God bless the class of 2017.\n","May God bless the United States of America.\n","May God bless all of you here today.\n","Thank you very much. Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," this is my third time and we love setting records, right? we always set records. we have no choice. there is no place in the world I’d rather be to give my first commencement address as president than here with my wonderful friends as Liberty University and a long time ago. thank you for everything you do to make this university exceptional, one of the truly great, great schools. --------------------------\n","592 \n","Original text: Jerry Falwell was a giant of a man.

And you know what, he opened the Bible a lot, didn't he?\n","I thank God for him.\n","He was a man who was committed to the Gospel. I guess that what's connected to me to Jerry so much. He believed with all of his heart that Jesus was the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that there was no way that anyone could have approached a holy God except through Jesus Christ. He believed it.\n","I thank God for Jerry Falwell.\n","One thing that I learned about Jerry Falwell: Jerry knew how to welcome sinners. And, he would disagree with you. And he did it with a smile. And people sensed that Jerry loved them. Even though he disagreed with them, he loved them.\n","You see, he believed in the Gospel -- that's controversial.\n","He believed in the inerrancy of Scripture -- that's controversial.\n","He believed in the sanctity of life; was against abortion -- that's controversial.\n","He believed in the family -- and who would've ever thought that would be controversial.\n","He believed in marriage was -- was the union between a man and a woman.\n","He believed that the moral decay weakened the fabric of America -- that's controversial.\n","He believed that political leaders should be men and women of integrity and of character and biblical values.\n","He believed in the local church.\n","God bless him.\n","God bless Jerry.\n","Jerry was a friend. And because Jerry Falwell opened up his arms to me, I have a whole new family of friends around the world because of Jerry Falwell.\n","Jerry Falwell has a personal stake in my own family. All four of my sons -- All for of my children -- my three sons and my daughter -- went to Liberty. My three boys found their wives here at Liberty. And I knew I was going to owe Jerry forever for that.\n","When asking around with my youngest -- or my oldest son, Will, was looking for a college I started, you know we, Jane and I started looking at Christian schools and universities.

What do you think?\" He said, \"I'm gonna tell you, Franklin.\" He said, \"There's something in that school.\" He said, \"The students up there they got a fire in their belly.\" He said, \"They -- They gotta a fire for the Gospel.\" He said, \"They come out of Liberty,\" he said, \"They come back into our church; they come back into our community, and they're and they're men and women of God, and they're standing for biblical principles.\" He said, \"You send your son to Liberty.\"\n","Boy I tell you what, I thank God for that advice.\n","They have a fire in their belly.\n","Says in 2 Thessalonians [2:15-17]: So then, brothers [and sisters], stand firm and hold to the teachings we've passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.

Though we were as politically opposite as two people could be, I truly respected his commitment to his beliefs and our mutual belief in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\" [Source: http://observer.com/2007/05/sharpton-and-falwell/]. And these lines attributed to a Chris Matthews \"Hardball\" episode: “Reverend Falwell and I didn't agree on anything, but we got along personally.\" \"He personally was genuinely a nice guy, and I would find him to be one of the few people in the public light who was genuine.” [Source: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070516154258AAn60GK] \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," he was a man of faith, christian, and prophet of our generation. people sensed that Jerry loved them, even though they disagreed with him, they sense that they liked them. if you've ever thought that would be controversial, you can't trust him. --------------------------\n","593 \n","Original text: During the final week of Richard Nixon’s life, I often imagined how he would have reacted to the tide of concern, respect, admiration, and affection evoked by his last great battle.\n","His gruff pose of never paying attention to media comment would have been contradicted by a warm glow and the ever so subtle hint that another recital of the commentary would not be unwelcome. And without quite saying so, he would have conveyed that it would mean a lot to him if Julie and Tricia, David and Ed were told of his friends’ pride in this culmination to an astonishing life.\n","In the conduct of foreign policy, Richard Nixon was one of the seminal Presidents. He came into office when the forces of history were moving America from a position of dominance to one of leadership. Dominance reflects strength. Leadership must be earned. And Richard Nixon earned that leadership role for his country with courage, dedication, and skill.\n","When Richard Nixon took his oath of office, 550,000 Americans were engaged in combat in a place as far away from the United States as it was possible to be. America had no contact with China, the world’s most populous nation; nor negotiations with the Soviet Union, the other nuclear superpower; most Muslim countries had broken diplomatic relations with the United States; and Middle East diplomacy was stalemated -- all of this in the midst of the most anguishing domestic crisis since the Civil War.\n","When Richard Nixon left office, an agreement to end the war in Vietnam had been concluded, and the main lines of all subsequent policy were established: permanent dialogue with China; readiness without illusions to ease tensions with the Soviet Union; a peace process in the Middle East; the beginning, via the European Security Conference, of establishing human rights as an international issue, weakening Soviet hold on Eastern Europe.\n","Richard Nixon’s foreign policy goals were long-range, and he pursued them without regard to domestic political consequences. When he considered our nation’s interest at stake, he dared confrontations despite the imminence of elections and also in the midst of the worst crisis of his life. And he bore -- if with some pain -- the disapproval of long-time friends and allies over relaxing tensions with China and the Soviet Union.\n","He drew strength from a conviction he often expressed to me: \"The price for doing things halfway is no less than for doing it completely; so we might as well do them properly.\" Thus Richard Nixon’s greatest accomplishment was as much moral as it was political: to lead from strength at a moment of apparent weakness; to husband the nation’s resilience and thus to lay the basis for victory in the Cold War.\n","Shy and withdrawn, Richard Nixon made himself succeed in the most gregarious of professions and steeled himself to conspicuous acts of extraordinary courage. In the face of wrenching domestic controversy -- controversy, he held fast to his basic theme that the greatest free nation in the world had a duty to lead and no right to abdicate.\n","Richard Nixon would be so proud that President Clinton and all living former Presidents of the United States are here, symbolizing that his long and sometimes bitter journey had concluded in reconciliation.\n","I wish that, in his final hours, I could have told him about Brian McDonnell who, during the Cambodian crisis, had been fasting on a bench in Lafayette Park across from the White House until, as he said, President Nixon redeemed his pledge to withdraw American forces from that anguished country in two months -- a promise which was, in fact, kept. Across the chasm of the decades, Brian called me the day Richard Nixon fell ill and left a message, \"When you talk to President Nixon, tell him that I am praying for him.\"\n","So let us now say goodbye to our gallant friend. He stood on pinnacles that dissolved into precipice. He achieved greatly, and he suffered deeply. But he never gave up. In his solitude, he envisaged a new international order that would reduce lingering enmities, strengthen historic friendships, and give new hope to mankind -- a vision where dreams and possibilities conjoined.\n","Richard Nixon ended a war. He -- and he advanced the vision of peace of his Quaker youth. He was devoted to his family. He loved his country; and he considered service his honor. It was a privilege to have been allowed to help him. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," he was one of the seminal presidents when the forces of history were moving America from dominance to leadership. when Richard Nixon took his oath of office, 550,000 americans were engaged in combat in a place as far away from the United States as it was possible to be. --------------------------\n","594 \n","Original text: Thank you. Good afternoon.\n","I want to thank Secretary [Mike] Pompeo for his friendship and his partnership and his leadership as we move forward on these issues.\n","One year ago, I traveled to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. On that occasion, I outlined the U.S. priorities for advancing human rights and I declared our intent to remain a part of the Human Rights Council -- if essential reforms were achieved. These reforms were needed in order to make the council a serious advocate for human rights. For too long, the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias.\n","Regrettably, it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded. Human rights abusers continue to serve on and be elected to the council. The world’s most inhumane regimes continue to escape scrutiny, and the council continues politicizing and scapegoating of countries with positive human rights records in an attempt to distract from the abusers in their ranks.\n","Therefore, as we said we would do a year ago if we did not see any progress, the United States is officially withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council. In doing so, I want to make it crystal clear that this step is not a retreat from human rights commitments; on the contrary, we take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights.\n","We did not make this decision lightly. When this Administration began 17 months ago, we were well aware of the enormous flaws in the Human Rights Council. We could have withdrawn immediately. We did not do that.\n","Instead, we made a good-faith effort to resolve the problems. We met with ambassadors of over a dozen countries in Geneva. Last September, in President Trump’s speech before the UN General Assembly, he called for member-states to support Human Rights Council reform. During High-Level Week last year, we'd led a session on Human Rights Council reform co-hosted by the British and Dutch foreign ministers, and more than 40 other countries.\n","Our efforts continued all through this year in New York, where my team met with more than 125 member-states and circulated draft texts. Almost every country we met with agrees with us in principle and behind closed doors that the Human Rights Council needs major, dramatic, systemic changes; yet no other country has had the courage to join our fight.\n","Meanwhile, the situation on the council has gotten worse, not better. One of our central goals was to prevent the world’s worst human rights abusers from gaining Human Rights Council membership. What happened? In the past year, the Democratic Republic of Congo was elected as a member. The DRC is widely known to have one of the worst human rights records in the world. Even as it was being elected to membership in the Human Rights Council, mass graves continued to be discovered in the Congo.\n","Another of our goals was to stop the council from protecting the world’s worst human rights abusers. What happened? The council would not even have a meeting on the human rights conditions in Venezuela. Why? Because Venezuela is a member of the Human Rights Council, as is Cuba, as is China.\n","Similarly, the council failed to respond in December and January when the Iranian regime killed and arrested hundreds of citizens simply for expressing their views.\n","When a so-called Human Rights Council cannot bring itself to address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member, the council ceases to be worthy of its name. Such a council, in fact, damages the cause of human rights.\n","For all these reasons, the United States spent the past year engaged in a sincere effort to reform the Human Rights Council. It is worth examining why our efforts didn’t succeed. At its core, there are two reasons. First, there are many unfree countries that simply do not want the council to be effective. A credible human rights council poses a real threat to them, so they opposed the steps that would create it.\n","Look at the council membership and you see an appalling disrespect for the most basic human rights. These countries strongly resist any effort to expose their abusive practices. In fact, that’s why many of them run for a seat on the Human Rights Council in the first place: to protect themselves from scrutiny. When we made it clear we would strongly pursue council reform, these countries came out of the woodwork to oppose it: Russia, China, Cuba, and Egypt all attempted to undermine our reform efforts this past year.\n","The second reason our reforms didn’t succeed is in some ways even more frustrating. There are several countries on the Human Rights Council who do share our values. Many of them strongly urged us to remain engaged in the council. They are embarrassed by the obsessive mistreatment of Israel. They share our alarm with the hypocrisy of countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Democratic Republic of Congo, and others serving on the council.\n","Ultimately, however, many of these like-minded countries were unwilling to seriously challenge the status quo. We gave them opportunity after opportunity and many months of consultations, and yet they would not take a stand unless it was behind closed doors. Some even admittedly were fine with the blatant flaws of the council as long as they could pursue their own narrow agenda within the current structure.\n","We didn’t agree with such a moral compromise when the previous UN Human Rights Commission was disbanded in 2006, and we don’t agree with it now. Many of these countries argued that the United States should stay on the Human Rights Council because American participation is the last shred of credibility that the council has. But that is precisely why we must leave. If the Human Rights Council is going to attack countries that uphold human rights and shield countries that abuse human rights, then America should not provide it with any credibility. Instead, we will continue to lead on human rights outside the misnamed Human Rights Council.\n","Last year, during the United States presidency of the Security Council, we initiated the first ever Security Council session dedicated to the connection between human rights and peace and security. Despite protests and prohibitions, we did organize an event on Venezuela outside the Human Rights Council chambers in Geneva. And this past January, we did have a Security Council session on Iranian human rights in New York.\n","I have traveled to the -- to UN refugee and internally displaced persons camps in Ethiopia, Congo, Turkey, and Jordan, and met with the victims of atrocities in those troubled regions. We have used America’s voice and vote to defend human rights at the UN every day, and we will continue to do so. Even as we end our membership in the Human Rights Council, we will keep trying to strengthen the entire framework of the UN engagement on human rights issues, and we will continue to strongly advocate for reform of the Human Rights Council. Should it become reformed, we would be happy to rejoin it.\n","America has a proud legacy as a champion of human rights, a proud legacy as the world’s largest provider of humanitarian aid, and a proud legacy of liberating oppressed people and defeating tyranny throughout the world. While we do not seek to impose the American system on anyone else, we do support the rights of all people to have freedoms bestowed on them by their Creator. That is why we are withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council, an organization that is not worthy of its name.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the united states is officially withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council. a year ago, he traveled to the United Nations human rights council in Geneva, and declared his intent to remain part of the council if essential reforms were achieved. it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded. the world’s most inhumane regimes continue to escape scrutiny. --------------------------\n","595 \n","Original text: Good afternoon, everybody.

All of the granite, marble and limestone that went into building the colonnades and statues that adorn this beautiful city speak to us of the enduring legacy of our great nation…of heritage and hope…tradition and trust…fairness and freedom…character and courage.\n","Collectively, these monuments also bear testimony to the enormous progress this country has made over the centuries…of men and women who were not afraid to embrace new ideas… and men and women who were not afraid to challenge the past and old ways of thinking.\n","However, the germination of any idea…the cultivation of a concept…is only the beginning. Then, begins the real work of teasing it into life, and growing it. And that process never ends. It’s one of continuous improvement. As IBM’s Thomas Watson said, \"Whenever an individual or business decides that success has been attained, progress stops.\" I am a firm believer that true progress in an institution such as the IRS is achieved by standing on the shoulders of those who have preceded us. We build on their work and try to take it to the next level.\n","This has been my experience as Commissioner of the IRS. I look back to what the IRS was like before the major reorganization took place in 1998 and where we are today…a sustained arc of progress that had a very different beginning.\n","Looking into the rear-view mirror, there was a time that the IRS was thought of as an organization that seemed mired in the past…one that had not kept pace with advances in technology…one that was slow to adapt to emerging best practices in customer service and compliance…and one that was slow to recognize an increasingly evolving and changing taxpayer base and the broad implications that a global economy had on the tax system.\n","But standing before you today…standing on the shoulders of those who began reimagining what the Internal Revenue Service could be in the 21st century…it is gratifying to see and share with you the meaningful…and I believe, lasting progress that has been made.\n","As IRS Commissioner, I am the head of a 100,000 employee financial services institution that processes over $2.5 trillion annually for over 200 million individuals, businesses, and non-profits.\n","People often ask me how do you get an organization as big as the IRS to move forward on key initiatives. Two of the key factors are to set the right strategy, one which people believe in and you can explain, and then to stay focused.\n","I’m a believer in relentless and myopic focus on priorities -- not getting distracted by too many crises or incoming demands -- and making sure that you communicate these priorities clearly inside and outside the institution that you run to ensure there is broad support. This is much easier said than done -- especially in a government agency -- but staying focused and consistent over multiple years is a key to success.\n","So today, I wanted to share with you some of the results of four years of relentless focus on a handful of strategic priorities we set for the IRS. The priorities are:\n","- Creating new capabilities and efficiencies through technology - Rethinking and reimagining the IRS’s relationship with paid tax return preparers - Leveraging data analytics for continuous improvement - Enhancing our taxpayer service capabilities - Transforming the agency to confront the challenges of a global economy, and - Positioning the IRS workforce to make sure that we are prepared for tomorrow’s challenges.\n","Let me begin with our efforts to modernize our technology, and one critical program in particular that’s called the Customer Account Data Engine -- or CADE2.\n","You may have seen video footage from the 1960s, where very earnest looking people load enormous tapes onto mainframe computers to perform what was then a magical feat of automated data processing. Fast forward more than 40 years, and although the tapes are much smaller, and robotic arms move them from place to place, the IRS still operates some of its core systems using the same basic technology. You might ask yourself -- why?\n","The answer is complicated, and has at least three parts.\n","First -- because it works. The IRS was one of the first institutions to deploy data processing on a large scale and some of the original systems were truly engineering marvels. Although they were advanced at the time, there are now a dwindling number of people who understand the old systems, and it is incredibly expensive to train new people on this obsolete technology.\n","Second -- because the IRS has built an elaborate set of newer systems and technologies that compensate for the shortcomings of the legacy systems. This means that some of the key technologies -- such as those for telephone routing or exam selection -- don’t need to rely on the old systems. It also means we have a very complex, fragile and interrelated set of old and new systems, the untangling of which is very complicated.\n","Third -- because there has been real reluctance to fund IRS technology in a way that is commensurate with its mission. The fact is that the IRS currently spends less than three percent of its budget on long-term enhancements to its IT infrastructure. When compared with large private sector financial institutions -- none of which come close to matching the number of customers that the IRS must support -- that percentage is shockingly low. The President has proposed a much-needed substantial increase in the IRS technology budget, in large part reflecting our critical mission.\n","With all of these factors in mind, when I arrived I initiated a broad review of the IRS technology portfolio. We pruned our portfolio of projects to focus on addressing the single most visible and complex issue that had been holding back the IRS for decades. Since the 1960s, the IRS had conducted its core account processing on a weekly basis. This processing included basic taxpayer information, such as your current account balance…whether you have outstanding amounts due…and whether you’ve made any recent payments.\n","I am pleased to report that this year the IRS successfully migrated from a weekly processing cycle to daily processing. This was a multi-year, incredibly complex undertaking that went to the heart of systems that process trillions of dollars in tax revenue. This is an incredibly important milestone for the IRS, one which we first set our sights on in the late 1980s.\n","The payoffs from this change are quicker tax return processing for all taxpayers, up-to-date information at the fingertips of our customer account representatives, and a platform for more real-time analytics and compliance. It is already benefiting taxpayers this year, and will produce major benefits for the nation’s tax system for years to come. Our next key long-term priority is an initiative that we started three years ago to look at how the IRS interacts with paid tax return preparers. And here’s the reason why we took on this challenge. One of the most important tasks millions of Americans have been tackling, and will be tackling over the next two weeks, is preparing an accurate and timely tax return.\n","However, over the past 20-30 years, the way that taxpayers go about filing their taxes has dramatically changed. Today, more than 9 out of 10 taxpayers use a paid tax preparer or tax software. Despite the fact that paying taxes is one of the largest financial transactions that the average American family has each year, when I arrived at the IRS, there were no basic competency requirements for tax return preparers. In fact, while in most states you need a license to cut someone’s hair, just a few years ago almost anyone could prepare a federal tax return for any other person for a fee, regardless of their level of experience or knowledge of the tax law.\n","Now, as the leader of the IRS, I am always looking for points of leverage -- and our return preparer initiative is just that. In essence, we shifted from a retail to a wholesale approach. We shifted resources from dealing with taxpayers one-by-one, to dealing with the intermediaries who deal with a hundred or a thousand taxpayers at a time. That’s what I mean by leverage.\n","To give you a sense of scale, 95 million individual and business income tax returns were prepared by paid preparers in 2011…and that doesn’t include self-prepared returns using software. The taxpayers served by paid preparers accounted for $5.7 trillion of income reported.\n","Given the importance of paid return preparers to the integrity of our tax system, we’re now well into the process of ensuring a basic competency level for tax return preparers and focusing our enforcement efforts on rooting out unscrupulous preparers. We have registered over 840,000 return preparers and have begun administering a competency test for any preparer who is not a CPA, attorney or enrolled agent. These individuals also have to complete 15 hours of continuing education each year from IRS-approved providers.\n","Our next major priority is leveraging data analytics in order to continually improve our operations.\n","The IRS has always been an information intensive enterprise. But it’s the organization of data and ultimately the knowledge and intelligence we extract from the information we receive that really matters. It can show us the areas of greatest non-compliance...and thereby, contribute to more efficient and effective compliance programs.\n","We have built a team of people with analytical expertise and connected them with our business units to continually improve our operations. They are working on multiple fronts, and the results have been impressive. Let me give you just one example of how we are leveraging data analytics, and how many of the strategic initiatives I have discussed come together.\n","Using better data on return preparers that we gained through our return preparer initiatives and faster processing cycles achieved through CADE2, we applied advanced data analytics to link tax returns that showed potentially serious compliance issues to the individuals who prepared them. We identified a number of preparers with apparently inaccurate returns and, depending on the type and severity of the issue, are applying different types of compliance tools.\n","The early results of this effort are encouraging, but we’ll need to remain focused on testing different techniques to continually improve our ability to accurately assess the compliance risks and determine what types of compliance activities are most effective. Based on what we learn, we will continuously make adjustments and improve the program.\n","In addition to finding and stopping more fraud this filing season, there are other benefits to combining the expertise and knowledge of our data analytics… return preparer… audit…and technology teams. Bringing them together enables us to improve our ability to understand trends in non-compliance on a number of fronts, and be able to identify and react to emerging compliance issues faster.\n","The example I gave you is just one of many where we are using advanced data analytics to significantly up our game.\n","But the IRS is not just about compliance. While popular culture generally links IRS with compliance and enforcement, the truth is that the IRS interacts with the overwhelming majority of the population strictly on a customer service basis. And providing quality customer service is a key priority of mine...and every bit as important as enforcement.\n","We provide numerous options to assist taxpayers in preparing and filing their taxes -- from tax forms and publications…to electronic filing services…to toll-free telephone, in-person, and Web options for getting in touch with the IRS on specific issues.\n","Now, every year, the American Customer Satisfaction Index measures customer satisfaction across various industries and government agencies. While we have many measures of customer service at the IRS, this composite index is the main measure we use to track our overall performance.\n","In 1998, the IRS had hit rock bottom. It reached an all-time low with only 32 percent of respondents to the American Customer Satisfaction Index survey voicing satisfaction with how we were doing our job. But over time, the IRS pulled out of this downward spiral. Slowly, but surely, it regained taxpayer approval as the IRS improved its services, such as e-file, and began offering new ones through our Web site. All of this hard work paid off. The numbers tell the story. For 2011, the American Customer Satisfaction Index survey of taxpayers showed satisfaction with the tax filing experience reaching 73 on a scale of 100 among all individual tax filers. That is our highest score since we began participating in the survey in 1994. I am especially proud of our continued progress in this metric, given the new responsibilities handed to the IRS in recent years…the increasing complexity of the tax code…and our continued drive to cut costs.\n","However, as a leader I believe that we must never stop innovating to meet the service needs of an increasingly diverse taxpayer base, and we must serve taxpayers where they need it and when they need it.\n","One of our most far reaching innovations…and one of the most successful modernization programs in government…is e-filing. Once just a glimmer in our eyes, the e-filing rate for individuals has grown from 16 percent 15 years ago to over 77 percent last year. In addition to a better customer experience, the cost savings are enormous. It costs only about 15 cents to process an e-filed return – a fraction of the approximately $3.50 it costs to process a paper return. And with e-file, taxpayers get their refunds faster, with fewer data processing errors that can lead to problems later in the process.\n","Let me give you another good example of innovation in the service area. More and more, we are communicating with taxpayers who may not get their information from traditional sources, such as newspapers and national news. In response to this trend, last year, we unveiled \"IRS2Go,\" our first smartphone application that lets taxpayers check on the status of their refund and obtain other helpful tax information on their iPhone or Android. You can expect us to continue to innovate in the service arena in the years to come.\n","Let me now talk about how the IRS is managing its responsibilities in an increasingly global environment. In a world where products are routinely sold after intellectual property is generated in one or more countries…where logistics and engineering are carried out in other countries…where risks are managed in a variety of places...and where components are sourced from multiple jurisdictions, figuring out what U.S. corporate income tax may be appropriate when the products go to market can be a challenge to say the least.\n","Both corporations and individuals operate in the global economy. For example, many individuals have global exposure through their investments and 401Ks. Yet, this fundamental shift to a more global economy has created a real set of challenges for the IRS. On the individual front, we have made putting a big dent in offshore tax evasion a major priority.\n","We view offshore tax evasion as an issue of fundamental fairness. Wealthy people who unlawfully hide their money offshore aren’t paying the taxes they owe, while schoolteachers, firefighters and other ordinary citizens who play by the rules are forced to pick up the slack.\n","Over the past four years, we have significantly increased our resources and focus on offshore tax evasion, and the results have been substantial. We upped the ante in a meaningful way with our work on Swiss financial institutions -- where for the first time in history, a bank secrecy jurisdiction turned over thousands of names and account numbers.\n","As we increased our enforcement efforts and gained significant momentum, we gave taxpayers a chance to come in voluntarily and avoid going to jail. In a typical year, we used to get 100 or so taxpayers who used our voluntary disclosure program. For this program, we thought that figure would rise to maybe 1,000.\n","So, we are very pleased that through the end of 2011, we’ve had approximately 33,000 voluntary disclosures from individuals who came in under several special programs we started in 2009. To date, these individuals have paid back taxes and stiff penalties amounting to more than $4.4 billion, and the number continues to grow. We are now mining the information we have received to date and have launched our next wave of investigations on banks, bankers, intermediaries and taxpayers.\n","Collecting additional revenue for past misdeeds -- as important as that may be -- is not the only consideration here. It is perhaps more important that we’re bringing U.S. taxpayers back into the system…back into compliance… so they properly report and pay their taxes for years to come. We have fundamentally changed the risk calculus of taxpayers who are thinking about hiding their money overseas, and we are well on our way to deterring the next generation of taxpayers from using hidden bank accounts to cheat on their taxes.\n","Now, we are also upping our game in the large business arena, particularly as it relates to international tax issues. We are shifting our international approach to be more strategic, and to view taxpayers through the prism of their business objectives and tax planning strategies. Indeed, our compliance strategy is starting to mirror the corporation’s tax planning strategy.\n","The end game is a way of organizing our international compliance programs to: identify the highest compliance risks among our taxpayer base…work cases as effectively and efficiently as possible…not waste our and taxpayers’ time on issues that do not pose compliance risk…and find appropriate ways to resolve cases as soon as possible.\n","We are also moving from information sharing to more coordinated action among government tax authorities on a global basis. I’m the chairman of the main global body of tax authorities, which is comprised of my counterparts from 43 nations, including those from all G20 nations. We have stepped up our coordinated efforts on offshore tax evasion by individuals, and have embarked on a project to conduct joint audits of certain multinational companies -- which should reduce administrative burden on a company and help increase compliance.\n","Now, after all that I’ve described…all of our service and compliance strategic priorities …one fact rises to the top…people are our most valuable asset and focusing on them is a strategic imperative. One of my core beliefs is that if we’re going to serve taxpayers well, we must have engaged and motivated employees.\n","While I spent my first 90 days as Commissioner listening and learning, during that time I also launched what I called the Workforce of Tomorrow Task Force with the stated objective of making the IRS the best place to work in government. We put an emphasis on key factors including engagement, accountability, career paths and management to position the agency for excellence in the future.\n","We put together a framework of priority items -- from speeding up hiring…to training people…to getting rid of managerial burden. We dealt with the big issues like culture, but also everyday things like employees being asked to travel for work, but not having the technology they need to get the job done efficiently while they are out of the office.\n","I am heartened to see that the work we started four years ago has penetrated our 100,000 person organization. From 2008 to 2011, we jumped from 8th place to 3rd place among the fifteen large agencies with over 20,000 employees in the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are making significant strides in being a people-focused organization.\n","On top of the proactive agenda I’ve just outlined, in recent years, the IRS has been called on more and more to play a vital role in key policy objectives set forth by Congress and the Administration. I call this final category of work \"incoming priorities,\" and it’s must-do work that’s critical to the country’s future. The IRS is now recognized as a highly efficient and effective institution to carry out important and high profile government initiatives. Our portfolio of duties was greatly expanded during the recession when we were called upon to help revive the economy. For example, about one-third of the Recovery Act, or approximately $300 billion, ran through the tax system and the IRS. That includes everything from the Making Work Pay credit, which gave 95 percent of Americans a tax break, to an expanded net operating loss carryback that enabled us to push out tens of billions of dollars to businesses when the credit markets were frozen. And we have recently been asked to play a significant role in the Affordable Care Act, because much of the “money flows” in that piece of legislation are effectuated through the tax system. The lesson learned here is that the IRS cannot afford to be rigid and calcified. We must be agile and nimble enough to react quickly to whatever the future may hold. So four years ago, we set out with a clear strategy and intense focus on six strategic priorities: technology modernization, tax return preparers, data analytics, taxpayer service, offshore tax evasion, and our people. The economic downturn and new policy directions added two other major initiatives to our agenda. But by staying focused, we have made significant headway in all of these areas and have made lasting positive changes in our nation’s tax system which will position it well to serve the American people for years to come. Thank you for listening, and I would be happy to take some questions. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the germination of any idea...the cultivation of a concept...is only the beginning, and that process never ends. it’s one of continuous improvement. we build on their work and try to take it to the next level. --------------------------\n","597 \n","Original text: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Convention:\n","If we could just know where we are and whither we appear to be tending, we could all better judge of what to do, and how to do it. We are now well into our fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident purpose of putting an end to slavery agitation.\n","However, under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion, it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\"\n","I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved -- I do not expect the house to fall -- but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest this further spread and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is on a course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates shall press it forward, until it shall become alike lawful in all of the States, old as well as new, North as well as South.\n","Have we no tendency to this latter condition?\n","Let any one who doubts this contemplate that now almost complete legal combination -- piece of machinery, so to speak -- compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision. Let him consider not only what work that machinery is adapted to, but how well adapted. Also, also, let him study the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design, of concert of action, among its chief bosses, from the very beginning.\n","The new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half of the States by State Constitutions, and from most of the national territory by Congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that Congressional prohibition. This opened all the national territory to slavery, and was the first point gained. But, so far, Congress only had acted; and an endorsement by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable, to save the point already gained, and to give chance for more.\n","This necessity had not been overlooked; it had been provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument of \"squatter sovereignty,\" and \"sacred right of self-government,\" which latter phrase, though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this particular application of it as to amount to just this: If any one man desires to enslave another, no third man has the right to object. Well that argument was incorporated into the Nebraska bill itself, in the language which follows: \"It being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, or to exclude it therefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" That opened a roar of loose declamation in favor of \"Squatter Sovereignty,\" and \"sacred right of self-government.\" \"But,\" said opposition members, \"let us be more specific, let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory may exclude slavery.\" \"Not we,\" said the friends of the measure; and down they voted the amendment.\n","Now, while the Nebraska bill was passing through Congress, a law case involving the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him into first a free State and then a Territory covered by that Congressional prohibition, and held him as a slave for a long time in each, was passing through the U. S. Circuit Court in the District of Missouri. Both the Nebraska bill and the law suit were brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854. The negro's name was \"Dred Scott,\" which name now designates the decision finally given in that case. Well, before the then next Presidential election, the law case came to, and was argued in, the Supreme Court of the United States; but the decision of it was deferred until after the election. Still, before the election, Senator Trumbull, on the floor of the Senate, requests the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a Territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the latter answers: \"That is a question for the Supreme Court.\"\n","The election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the endorsement, such as it was, was secured. That was the second point gained. The endorsement, however, fell short of a clear popular majority by some four hundred thousand votes, and, I think, was not overwhelmingly reliable or satisfactory. The outgoing President, in his last annual message, as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of this endorsement. The Supreme Court met again; did not announce their decision, but ordered a re-argument. The Presidential inauguration came -- still no decision of the court; but the incoming President in his inaugural address, fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision, whatever it may be. Then, in a few days, came the decision.\n","The reputed author of the Nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capital building endorsing the Dred Scott decision, vehemently denouncing all opposition to it. The new President, too, seizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter to endorse and strongly construe that decision, and to express his astonishment that any should ever had any different view than that.\n","At length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of the Nebraska bill, on the mere question of fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution was in fact, in any just sense, made by the people of Kansas; and in the squabble the latter declares all he wants is a fair vote for the people; he don't care whether it gets voted down or voted up -- slavery, that is.\n","I do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted up, to be intended as anything other than an apt definition of the policy that he wants -- wants to impress upon the public mind -- the principle for which he declared he has suffered much and intends to suffer until the end. Well -- Well may he cling to that principle. If he has any parental feeling at all, well may he cling to it for under the Dred Scott decision \"squatter sovereignty\" has squatted right out of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding -- like -- like the mould at a foundry served cast off into the sand -- never to be used again. It helped to carry the election and then was kicked into the winds. His late joint struggle with the Republicans, against the Lecompton Constitution -- it involved nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. The struggle was made on a point -- the right of the people to form their own constitution -- of which we and he have never even differed.\n","Well the several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection, with Senator Douglas's \"don't care\" policy, constitute a major piece of machinery, in its present state of advancement. And this was the third point gained. Now the working points of that machinery are:\n","First, no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no descendant of any such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense that that term is used in the Constitution of the United States. Now this point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the benefit of this provision of the United States Constitution, which declares \"The citizens of each State, shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States.\"\n","Secondly, that \"subject to the Constitution of the United States,\" neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can exclude slavery from any United States territory. This point was made in order that individuals may fill up the Territory with slaves, without danger of ever losing their property in the slaves -- thus to enhance the chance of the permanency to that institution through all future.\n","Thirdly, that whether the holding of a negro in actual slavery in a free State, makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will not decide, but they'll leave it to be decided by the courts of any slave State where the master of that slave decides to take him.\n","This point was made, not to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for awhile, endorsed by the people apparently at an election, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master may lawfully do with Dred Scott, in the free State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do with every other one, or one thousand of like slaves, in Illinois, or in any other free State.\n","And then auxiliary to all this, and working in hand with it, we have the Nebraska doctrine, or what's left of it, to educate, to mold public sentiment, to not care whether slavery is voted down or up. This shows exactly where we are, partially, also, whither we are tending.\n","Now it will throw additional light on the -- the latter, to go back, to run the mind over this string of historical facts already stated. Several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did then when they were transpiring. The people were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject only to the Constitution\" of the United States. What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not then tell. Plainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche, for the Dred Scott decision afterwards to come in, and declare that perfect freedom to be just no freedom at all.\n","Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people to exclude slavery, voted down? Plainly enough now: the adoption of it would have spoiled that niche for the Dred Scott decision. Why was the court decision held up? Why even a Senator's individual opinion withheld, till after the Presidential election? Plainly enough now: speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried. Why the outgoing President's felicitation of the endorsement? Why the delay of the reargument? Why the incoming President's advance exhortation in favor of that decision, whatever it might be? These things look like the cautious patting and petting of a much-spirited horse, when it's a-feared that, upon mounting, he'll be thrown. Why the hasty after-endorsements of the decision by the President and others?\n","We cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, which we know different portions of which have been gotten out at different times and in different places by different workmen -- Stephen, Franklin, Roger, James, for instance -- and when we see these timbers joined together, and see that they exactly frame a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices fitting exactly together, all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or a piece too few -- not omitting even scaffolding -- or, if a single piece be lacking, we can see the place in the frame where it is fitted and prepared yet to be put in. In such a case, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning; all worked on a common plan or draft drawn before the first lick was struck.\n","Now, it shouldn't be overlooked that, by the Nebraska bill, the people of a State as well as Territory, were to be left \"perfectly free,\" \"subject only to the Constitution.\" Why mention a State? They were legislating for Territories, not for or about States. Certainly the people of a State are and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United States; but why is the mention of this lugged into a merely Territorial law? Why are the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein lumped together, and their relation to the Constitution treated as being precisely the same? While the opinion of the court, by Chief Justice Taney, in the Dred Scott's case, and the separate opinions of all the concurring Judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of the United States neither permits Congress nor a Territorial Legislature to exclude slavery from any United States Territory, they all omit to declare whether or not that same Constitution permits a State, or the people of a State, to exclude it.\n","Possibly, this was a mere omission; but who can be quite sure, if McLean or Curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a State to exclude slavery from their limits, just as Chase and Mace sought to get such declaration, in behalf of the people of a Territory, in the Nebraska bill; -- I ask, who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down in the one case as it had been on the other? The nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a State over slavery was made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise [idea], almost the language, too, of the Nebraska act. On one occasion, his exact language is, \"except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdictions.\"\n","In what cases the power of the States is so restrained by the United States Constitution, is left an open question, precisely as the same question, as to the restraint on the power of the Territories, was left an open in the Nebraska Act. Well when you put that and that together, we have another nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled by another Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a State to exclude slavery from its limits. And this may especially be expected if this doctrine of \"care not whether slavery is voted down or voted up\" shall gain in the public mind sufficiently to give promise that that decision will be maintained when it's made.\n","Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all of the States. Welcome or [un]welcome, such decision is probably coming, and will soon be upon us, unless the power of the political dynasty at present shall be met and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of Missouri are about to make their State a free one, and we shall wake up to discover that the Supreme Court has just made Illinois a slave State. To meet and to overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation. That is what we have to do. But how can we best do it?\n","There are those who denounce us openly to their own friends, and yet whisper to us that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument for this work...with which to effect this object. They do not tell us, nor has he told us that he wishes any such object to be affected. They wish us to infer it, you see, from all the facts that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of this dynasty; and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point, upon which we and he had never differed. They remind us that he is a very great man, and the largest of us are little ones. Well, let this be granted. But \"a living dog is better than a dead lion.\" And Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion, for this work, is at least a caged and toothless one. How can he oppose the advances of slavery? He don't care whether it gets voted down or voted up. His avowed mission is to impress the \"public heart\" to care nothing whether its voted down or voted up.\n","A leading Douglas democratic newspaper thinks Douglas's superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the African slave trade. Does Douglas believe an effort to revive the African slave trade is approaching? He's not said so. Does he really think so? If it is, how can he resist it? For years he's labored to prove it a sacred right for men to take negro slaves into the new Territories. Can he possibly show that its less a sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheaper? Unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in Africa than in Virginia. He's done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a right of property; and as such, how can he oppose the foreign slave trade -- how can he refuse that trade in that \"property\" shall be \"perfectly free\"? -- unless he does it as a protection to those who are home producers. Well, then, as the home producers will probably not ask for that the protection, he shall be wholly without any ground of opposition.\n","Senator Douglas know that a man can rightfully be wiser today than he was yesterday -- that he can rightfully change when he finds himself to be wrong. But can we, for that reason, run ahead, and infer that he will make any particular change, of which he, himself, has never given any intimation? Can we safely base our action upon some vague inference? Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent Judge Douglas's position or question his motives, or do aught that would be personally offensive to him. But whenever, if ever, he and we can come together on principle so that our great cause may have the assistance of his great ability, I hope to have imposed no adventitious obstacle upon him. But clearly, he is not now with us -- he does not pretend to be -- he does not promise ever to be.\n","Our cause, then, must be entrusted to, and conducted by, its own undoubted friends -- those whose hands are free and whose hearts are in the work -- who do care for the result. Two years ago the Republicans of this nation mustered some thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under a single impulse of resistance to a common danger, with every external circumstance against us. Of strange, discordant, even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds; we fought the battle through under the constant hot fire of a pampered, proud, disciplined army. Did we brave all then only to falter now? -- now, when that same enemy is wavering, dissevered, and belligerent? The result is not doubtful. We shall not fail -- if we stand firm, we shall not fail. Wise counsels may accelerate, or mistakes delay, but sooner or later the victory is sure to come. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half of the states by Congressional prohibition. john sutter: congress only had acted; a endorsement by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable, to save the point already gained, and to give chance for more. --------------------------\n","598 \n","Original text: Thanks. Thanks very much. I am indeed delighted, honored to be here to be part of the Landon Lecture series. My wife joins me. We’re in the midst of travel across the country. I have been trying to get here for some time actually and -- and this year we finally were able to accomplish the task.\n","I come here just by coincidence on the day that I begin my second year as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I became the Chairman one year ago today and I’m honored to fill that position at -- at this time in our nation’s history, and to represent more than two million men and women in uniform, and probably twice that when you count their families. And some of those great Americans are here today and let's ask you all to stand up one more time. If you’re here in uniform stand up so the rest of us can give you a round of applause.\n","Thanks. For those of you currently serving, duty first! Let’s try that again. For those of you currently serving, duty first! There you go.\n","I was with the Big Red One in Afghanistan last month. For those of you that are serving elsewhere, thanks for that as well. And for, I mean what you’ve got framed here in this audience today is probably the senior, I was going to say oldest but I didn’t like the way that was going to sound, of serving active duty officers. I’m not actually -- there’s a handful but only a handful that are more -- that are older than me but 38 years of service and I’m guessing we’ve got a couple of freshmen cadets here. My promise to you is we will leave something for you to do.\n","So, President Schultz, Jackie Hartman, Ed Seaton, staff and faculty thanks for inviting me here and thanks for what you do. I, the -- the other reason I'm glad to be here on the one year anniversary -- anniversary is that this is. I'm going to talk a little bit about the relationship of the country to its men and women in uniform. And I can’t think of anything where that relationship is so powerful than right here in Manhattan, Kansas between and including the relationship between Kansas State University and the United States Army at Fort Riley, Kansas. Whether it’s health of the force connections, whether it’s unmanned aerial systems, whether it’s education in general I really -- I really appreciate what this community and this university do for those who serve.\n","I’m mindful of the legacy of Alf Landon by the way. As you know, among those 160 speakers who have been here with you and part of the series, there’s been seven presidents, several of my predecessors. In 1966, Alf Landon presented the first of those lectures or what would become those lectures and it was titled, \"New Challenges of International Relations.\"\n","Well, I would venture to say that we too serve in an era in our history where we have our fair share of new challenges in international relations. I’ll mention a few of them, not by way of being able to go into any detail about them. I could certainly address some of them in the Q and A session, but by way of showing you how these security challenges will bridge to the conversation I want to have with you about America’s relationship with men and women in uniform.\n","I describe one of these new international relationship challenges as a security paradox: We live in an era where we're at an evolutionary low in violence. I mean, there are people who are studying this at the -- at colleges and universities around the country. And they've concluded that we are literally at an evolutionary low in violence. State on state conflict is far less likely than it has been in the past.\n","The problem is that other kinds of conflict, other kinds of violence are exponentially more likely as technology spreads, as the information age allows organizations and individuals, middle-weight nations if you will, to have capabilities that heretofore were the purview of major nation states. So it’s a paradox in some way. The paradox being nation on nation, state on state, large conflict is less likely, not completely unlikely but less likely.\n","But the chance of violence and those using violence for ideological and other purposes is exponentially greater:\n","- The Arab Spring and what it will bring. The Arab Spring, as many of you have seen and probably are studying, will introduce a period of instability, is introducing a period of instability. I think that in the long run it has a very good chance of producing stability, but getting from here to there will be a challenge for not only for the United States but the region; and I would venture to say, the globe.\n","- Iran's nuclear ambitions -- which will have to be considered in any strategy that both we and our partners in the Middle East take upon ourselves in the future.\n","- Shifting trends, global trends really that are pulling our attention into the Pacific, economic, demographic, and military trends. And as you know our new defense strategy seeks to address those shifting global trends.\n","- Cyber security. Cyber is the new domain, if you will: land domain, air domain, maritime domain, cyber domain. And we -- we have both incredible opportunities in cyber and we also have some significant vulnerabilities in cyber.\n","- And a new fiscal environment. If anybody in the room thinks that my defense budget is going to go up in the next several years, please show me your hands, I’d like to know what bar and grill you happen to frequent. I know that Aggieville is probably just about to open and I’d send you back if I see your hand. Or maybe you’ve been having too many of those maple bacon donuts that I’ve heard so much about.\n","Look, we are living in a new fiscal environment and the -- and we those of us who serve and the department in which I serve will have to be part of solving, helping the nation solve it. And we're -- we’re hard at that and I'd be happy to talk to you about that if you’re interested.\n","I -- I'm a fan of besides the poetry, I like to -- to dabble in a lot of different academic areas, mostly to keep my mind sharp and make sure that we’re not missing some way to articulate the challenges in front of us, and try to seek some of those solutions.\n","I read recently about Danish physicist Per Bak and his sand pile theory. Sand pile theory, now this guy mustn’t had much to do. I hope nobody is around here doing it exactly this way, but he -- he built sand piles a grain at a time until they collapsed. And he did this over a period of time to try to determine if there was a way to predict when the sand pile would collapse. And what he concluded is that what happens internal to the sand pile is more important than what happens to it externally, and he described that as unmappable dynamism. I think we live in a period where we’re going to prove to ourselves that Per Bak had it about right. Very uncertain times. It reminds me, though, as well, that we’re not the first ones to confront many of these challenges and these uncertainties and these huge tectonic shifts. One of my predecessors as Army Chief of Staff penned this memorandum to his subordinates in August of 1945, “In the next year, we’ll cut the military in half. We’ll retool the defense industrial base from a wartime footing to a peacetime footing, and we must account for increasing U.S. interests in the Pacific.”, signed, George C. Marshall. So maybe, after all, we’re not facing anything entirely new. They do say, if you want a new idea, read an old book. So you better start reading. Look, we can explore any or all of those during the Q and A, but in the next few minutes, I’d like to explore a different kind of challenging relationship, and that is the relationship of America with those in the military.\n","You know, relationships are always a little challenging. I was, in… the introduction you heard that I served during operation Desert Storm in 1991. And I remember, that was the days before texting and Skypeing and Facebooking and FaceTiming and, you know, words that exist today that didn’t exist, to tell you the truth, in 1991. We sent -- We sent letters back and forth to each other. And they would pass, and you know, you’d be answering questions from two letters ago and it just, it really was pretty challenging, actually.\n","We -- We did it, but it was challenging, and I remember this one particular letter where I got, that I got from Deanie, and in it, it said, you know, I’m so miserable without you. It’s almost as though you’re actually right here with me. And I thought -- I thought to myself, boy I hope she got that sentence structure wrong, because otherwise I’m in big trouble when I come back -- come back home.\n","But relationships are challenging. You know, you’ve seen it inside your own families. Externally we have relationships around the world. But I’m suggesting to you that the relationship of -- of America and its men and women in uniform is good, could be better, could be a little deeper. And we can’t take it for granted and so I want to talk about it.\n","You know, we are, I -- I grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey, 1952, just after that group of -- of men, mostly in those days, had come back from World War II. And so I saw how their image, the image of the veteran of World War II was shaped not just by them, but by the society into which they were absorbed. I saw the same thing after Korea somewhat. I saw the same thing after Vietnam. I saw the same thing after Desert Storm.\n","And what I’m suggesting to you is we ought to be thinking about now, what is the image, what is the veteran that you, the American people, many of you are veterans or will be veterans. And it’s got to be a two-way street in answering that question. The veterans themselves can’t answer it, nor can you answer it by yourselves. And we need to get after that.\n","Now, some of you might know that some of the older folks in the audience, who will not admit that, but some of you might know that in this month 35 years ago, October of 1977, my favorite rock band, back to the music connection, my favorite rock band, The Who, recorded what I think is potentially one of the best rock songs of all times, called “Who Are You.”\n","If you remember the story, and some of you may, Peter Townshend, the lead guitarist and vocalist, was going through this inner struggle about who he was because he says, in one of the lyrics, “I must have lost my direction because I ended up a superstar.” And he ended up having some significant problems in his life that he was trying to capture in that song, “Who Are You.”\n","More of you will know the song, because it’s also the theme song of crime scene investigators, the “CSI” series, that’s probably where you really know it. But listen to the lyrics sometime. And I would suggest to you that you might ask who are you? You really ought to know because, as I said, you will define, those of you in uniform and those of you not in uniform, you will define today’s veterans as previous generations have defined veterans in their time.\n","Now, at one level, we’re who we’ve always been, America’s sons and daughters from all across the country from all walks of life from myriad backgrounds. As I mentioned, over 2 million active Guard and Reserve, proud to wear the cloth of the nation, proud to represent it and to go wherever and do whatever we need to do to serve in peace and in war. That’s enduring.\n","At another level, there are some things that are different about our service now, things that you really ought to know about. We’re an all-volunteer force. It rolls off the tongue, but what does it really mean? We’re an all-volunteer force. Some of you may know that only one in four of America’s young men and women can pass the entrance requirements to even serve in the military. That’s got to mean something to the nation.\n","We’re mostly married now. That wasn’t the case when I came into service in 1974. As of just a few months ago, we now are serving in the longest conflict in our nation’s history. We’ve asked a significant contribution, probably the most significant contribution over time of our reserve component than we have in our history. Add all those things together and add to it that most of us now have served repetitive tours in combat, that is to say a year in and a year out for the active component, a year in and three years or so out for the Reserve component.\n","There’s also some things you ought to know about conflict today that are different. For one thing, it’s asymmetric. It, there is this constant and there’s always been some asymmetry in warfare, but it’s far more prevalent today that our adversaries will seek and find ways to offset our advantages and leverage some of theirs, asymmetric. So you have to constantly be adapting to what’s going on around you.\n","Second thing is it’s persistent. There’s no let’s go to the rear and take a break. When you’re in it, you’re in it and it’s part of your life. It’s part of your daily life. It’s a moment-to-moment. Think about a young man or woman on patrol in parts of Afghanistan today where the IED, the pressure plate underground buried mine is a prevalent form of warfare. And the incredible courage on the one hand, but the incredible anxiety on the other, of not knowing whether your next step could potentially be your last. It’s persistent.\n","It’s nonlinear. It’s everywhere. There is no place to go to find sanctuary. It’s decentralized. And what I mean by that is a young captain might have more responsibility, more authority, more capability at his disposal than a colonel did in previous conflicts. Or a lieutenant colonel battalion commander will have more capability, authority and responsibility than I had as a division commander in Baghdad in 2003.\n","And here’s an important one, we take our families to war with us. Now, of course I don’t mean that literally, but I mean it absolutely, figuratively, and I mean it emotionally. It’s absolutely not uncommon, or to -- to avoid the double negative, it is absolutely common that a young man or woman will be Skypeing or texting or emailing or FaceTiming and say, “Hey look, I got to go now. I got to go out on patrol. I’ll call you when I get back.”\n","Happens every day all the time everywhere and that puts a different kind of -- of emotional pressure on both sides, by the way. Now look, that’s just the reality of the conflict in which we find ourselves. But when you add it all together, I think it’s important for you to know who we are. The question is who are you in all of that?\n","So what does that require of those who serve, many of whom are sitting in this audience today? Well, courage, but that’s not a new requirement really is it? I do want to tell you about one particular airman I met actually, Air National Guard Master Sergeant Roger Sparks, Alaska Air Guard. And he’s a parajumper.\n","Parajumpers are these fellows and gals who lower themselves out of usually Black Hawk helicopters on a cable, on a wire rope to rescue someone. Coast Guard does it at sea, this guy was happening to do it in Afghanistan on the side of the Hindu Kush with the 10th Mountain Division. And on a particular day, on a particularly -- on a particularly difficult piece of terrain, he pulled 12 soldiers off the side of a cliff fundamentally, under fire. Four of them died in his arms. He -- He recovered all 12. Four of them died in his arms.\n","And -- And each time he lowered himself he was attacked by machine gun fire from the enemy. And in fact, the wire rope on which he was suspended was struck twice and held up under the fire. That’s -- That’s courage. There’s something else there too. It’s some kind of sense of belonging or some -- some sense of loyalty to comrades.\n","Resilience. Again, not necessarily a new characteristic of those who serve, but I would suggest to you that it’s resilience that’s being tested in ways that it hasn’t been in a very long time. I met, not so long ago, when I was asked to be the head of delegation for the Paralympics. I was honored to represent the United States as the head of delegation to the Paralympics.\n","And I met Navy Lieutenant Brad Snyder. He was blinded one year ago in Afghanistan. This year he won two gold medals and a silver. Now that’s resilience. If you’re looking in the dictionary for resilience, look there. And that -- that by the way applies not only to our men and women who serve, but to the families that support them. That’s who we are. Who are you?\n","Resolve. Now, this is a peacetime example but it’s worth noting. I have a young sergeant first class working in my outer office by the name of Samantha Johnson. Samantha Johnson’s about five foot two, as mean as a snake, strong as an ox. Here’s what Samantha’s done. She deployed to Iraq as a driver for an EOD team, explosive ordinance demolitions, that is to say a route clearance team, and she was a driver.\n","She came back and almost immediately in her particular specialty, they needed somebody in Afghanistan because the guy who was doing the job had gotten, had come down with cancer. So she deployed almost immediately, back to back. She is a drill sergeant, was a drill sergeant. She is working on her second master’s. And she has a part-time job as a security guard so she can pay off her mortgage. I’d -- I’d call that resolve. That young lady knows what she wants.\n","And then adaptable. This one might be the one where I would suggest to you that today’s form of conflict requires a special emphasis on a particular attribute and that attribute is adaptability. We’ve got to be faster on our feet. We’ve got to be inquisitive. You know, Einstein once said, probably being a little falsely humble, but he said, “You know, I’m not really the smartest guy, but I’m passionately inquisitive.”\n","And I think that’s a quality that we need to encourage, not just in the men and women in uniform, by the way, but really in our nation, to be passionately inquisitive; to keep up, in our case, with -- with what changes on the battlefield, but in the case of the population in general, what takes place in everyday -- in everyday technology changes, in everyday relationship issues, passionate curiosity.\n","So what we’ve done over the past 10 years, I would describe to you, is we’ve overcome physical fear. Physical fear is always part of the battlefield. We’ve overcome physical fear by developing new instincts.\n","You know that when that big tsunami hit in Thailand about six or seven years ago now, you probably read the story that the animals ran. When the animals sensed that the sea was receding, the animals headed inland and up, and up to higher elevations. The people there on vacation said wow isn’t this cool? Let’s go out and see what’s at the bottom of this, and what happened? Back in came the tsunami and killed far too many.\n","We’ve got to have new instincts for the world in which we find ourselves. And we’ve got to maintain, importantly, that sense of belonging and that sense of purpose that has defined us throughout our history as military but also has defined us throughout our history as Americans.\n","So that’s kind of maybe the obvious. Let me state a little bit of the less obvious. Many times even the toughest of veterans that are coming home will tell you that in some ways coming home is tougher than being in the combat zone. Why would that be? Well, remember I mentioned repetitive tours. It’s the emotional fear of constantly having to reintegrate with your family as they grow while you’re not there. That’s a reality.\n","Secondly, there is in combat a very singular focus. You know exactly what you have to do. Your purpose is defined, your mission is clear. The enemy will always confuse you at times. There’ll be fog and friction, but you have a sense of clarity that’s uncanny in combat. And then you return and here’s the words of one particular veteran, to the million tiny anxieties of life outside the combat zone. He described it, this particular writer, as going from war at, where war is at max volume and in the foreground, and coming back to where war is at much lower volume and in the background. Max value, max volume and in the foreground; low volume and in the background. And it’s difficult for our veterans to reconcile that.\n","And finally and importantly, they’re coming back into the uncertainty of a difficult economic situation, a difficult economic environment and the uncertainty of employment.\n","Now, look, I’m only telling you that to support my thesis here, which is we’re -- we’re at that point now, after ten years of prolonged conflict and what appears to be continued challenges of that nature going into the future because of my security paradox. The question is, then, what is that image? What -- What image is in your mind of the veteran? And is there some -- something you should be doing to help shape it? The veterans of the past decade are you, or at least that’s what they want to be. Each in their own way has served heroically. Each in their own way has served heroically, but they’re not all heroes. Many have experienced real horrors of war, but they’re not all victims. All have served America and want to continue to serve her as they transition into your civilian communities.\n","On that basis alone, on the expectation that it’s in our shared interest, you and I, in and out of uniform, that we allow this generation of veterans to contribute, to bring the strengths that they bring, to bring the passionate curiosity that I’ve described, notwithstanding the pressures that they’ve felt. To the extent that we should agree that we all want a stronger America, then we ought to find a way to make sure that these veterans are part of it. And we ought to work together with them, not for them, with them.\n","Ultimately, who are you is a question that must be answered both by these veterans and the nation that sent them to war. I’ll end with a favorite quotation of mine, “Bad times, hard times, this is what people keep saying. But let us live well, and the times shall be good. We are the times. Such as we are, such are the times.” St. Augustine, fourth century. Thank you very much.\n","Moderator: Wonderful comments and your thought-provoking theme. I know that I confused many of you when I came up here. I look so much like Kirk Schulz. My name is April Mason, and I serve as the Provost here at Kansas State. I thought I might clear that up. The general will take questions now. We have microphones on either side of the auditorium. I’d ask you to make your way to those and wait for me to recognize you to pose the question. And we greatly appreciate you being willing to take questions, General.\n","Please. Q: I was wondering, you said that the military today is going to have to take cuts. In your opinion, what would be areas that it can take cuts, and what are areas that are most important for funding?\n","Dempsey: What I, yeah, what I really said, what the general meant to say was -- was that I think the Defense Department, as well as the rest of the… entire governmental enterprise, will have to find ways to help us address our common economic challenges, and that I expect, therefore, that I’ll have a smaller budget rather than a big one. I, you know, the… cut question assumes that the reductions will be taken on the back of force structure or end strength. And that’s not necessarily, we’ve already got some end strength reductions planned. I don’t know that we know enough about whether sequestration will be detriggered or not to know whether we have to look at other force structure reductions. That -- That remains to be seen.\n","That said, the real question is what needs to change based on the lessons of the last ten years of war? And I would venture to say that among the changes are that, I -- I mentioned decentralization. Conflict is somewhat decentralized and networked. So the military that I came into started thinking about conflict as large organizations that would disaggregate as necessary. I’m suggesting that potentially we -- we will need to begin to think about building small organizations that can aggregate as necessary. And that’ll bring us to some conclusions about changes to force structure.\n","Q: Sir, I have a question. What is, what’s your advice for the next military leaders of tomorrow?\n","Dempsey: Cheer me on, because if I leave you a mess, you’re not going to be very happy about it. No, I’m kidding. I’ll give you something. My advice -- My advice is to, you know, you’ve already, what, are you in the service? Are you coming into the service? Where are you? Where, who are you?\n","Go ahead. Q: Sir, I’m the Reserve, but I’m also ROTC cadet here at K-State.\n","Dempsey: Great. Well, look, I, you know, I think you’ve made a decision. I mean…, I could answer a question with a question about why you chose to do what you’re about to do. But I think I know most of the answer, and, because you’re looking for that sense of purpose, that sense of belonging that -- that the military provides young men and women. I -- I would suggest to you that at -- at whatever rank you find yourself, you know, you’re going to start out as a second lieutenant. Be the best second lieutenant you can be. Bloom where, you know, bloom where you’re planted. I’ll take care of Washington, D.C., you take care of Fort Riley, Kansas, and I think we’ll be fine.\n","Q: Good afternoon, sir. I am Abdulraheem Alkhiary, dual major here at, in political science and finance. I would like first of all to thank you on behalf of the Saudi Club for serving in the Gulf War. Second of all, there is many things going on in the old world. You have Afghanistan and you have the Arab Spring, et cetera. Two questions comes out of that. The situations that are happening right now in Afghanistan, where you have many U.S. soldiers getting shot by their Afghani colleagues, the question comes, why, what encourages the Afghanis to shoot their colleagues? What’s the cause of that? I want to get your opinion from that.\n","And would the U.S. change their relationship, the second question, would the U.S. change its relationship somehow with Libya, Egypt and Tunisia because of the protests that’s been happening around the embassies and the murder of the U.S. ambassador in Libya? Thank you.\n","Dempsey: Yeah, I’d… have to stay here for two or three days to do justice to those questions, but -- but I will give you, I’ll -- I’ll react to both very briefly.\n","First of all, Afwan, It was my great honor to serve in the –- in the 1991, as it is today.\n","Secondly, on the, we call them insider attacks. The one thing we’ve learned over the past ten years I think is that we’ve reinforced, you know, for every really complex problem, there’s a simple solution and it’s almost always wrong. So this is a really complex issue, one that demands that we understand it, and that as we understand it, we do that collaboratively with our Afghan partners.\n","It’s, it is a -– it is, as I’ve said before, a very serious threat, and one that we are seized with addressing. We’re… likely not to eliminate it entirely, but I think we can do a heck of a lot better at getting it under control, especially if we get the cooperation of our Afghan partners. And I met just last week with the new minister of defense of… Afghanistan, the new minister of interior, a couple of the corps commanders. And I’m, I left there convinced that they are as concerned about this as we are. But we’ve got a lot of work to do. And it is -- it is a tactic being employed by the Taliban and those who are ideologically opposed to the kind of Afghanistan we see in the best interests, both of them and us, in the future.\n","The Arab Spring is kind of the same, it’s, meaning it’s that complex geopolitical issue with -- with ideological and religious undertones. It is, it has, you know, dozens of stakeholders who are seeking to influence the outcome. You asked will we abandon it just because of, I shouldn’t say just because. Will we abandon it because of some of the recent demonstrations and riots and even the loss of our -– of our Ambassador?\n","You know, Ambassador Chris Stevens would be the first one to say, the first one to say under no circumstances should we abandon that part of the world simply because of the acts of a few terrorists, fundamentally. And so I don’t think we will. But we’ve got, you know, this is a very complex time, and we want to make sure that we employ all of the instrumentst we partner with those who have common interests in the region to try to find a way to -- to settle those issues for the long term.\n","Q: General, thank you, excuse me. General, thank you for coming. What, in your view, is the strategic value of the bases outside the United States? We have bases in Japan, Germany, South Korea. In light of the rapid-response abilities of the current U.S. military, carrier battle groups, Marines, airborne, et cetera? And are those bases outside the U.S., are they worth the cost and political struggle? Thank you.\n","Dempsey: Yeah, I’m -- I’m actually one who -- who believes very strongly in maintaining a forward presence for a couple of reasons that, some which are obvious. The access issue is -- is clearly one of them, but also what it does for us. I think, meaning the development of our leaders, I think there is a significant advantage to allowing our leaders to grow up inside of different cultures, different languages, different customs and traditions, so we get to know each other before we potentially have to go fight with each other, because it’s, I’m telling you, what I’ve learned over the -- over the, even just this first year as Chairman is that at the end of the day, you know, process, it’s important to understand process.\n","It’s vital to build relationships. And I think that our presence allows us to build a relationship of trust that just our deployments wouldn’t allow. I mean, my wife and I have lived in Germany for 12 years, we lived together in Saudi Arabia for two years and I’ve been in Iraq for three. And if you add up my time in Afghanistan, it’s probably one-plus. And so obviously you’re talking to someone who believes we really -- we really have to be engaged in the world to help influence it, not do it from 6,000 -- 6,000 miles away.\n","Q: Sir, I’m a cadet in the Air Force ROTC here. I’m about to graduate this May, and I was wondering what the Air Force or the military in general, in the Pacific, what you see being the focus of our mission, say, five, ten years where I’ll be serving?\n","Dempsey: Well, I, you know, as you know, the new defense strategy talked about rebalancing to the Pacific. We’ve been very careful not to describe that as a light switch, you know, one day you’re there, the next day you’re not. We never left, really. We just shifted our balance to the Mideast because that’s where the security, the greatest security issues of the last ten years have -- have happened to reside.\n","I think it’s a fair, as again, as you watch demographic trends, economic trends and military trends, you will see them trending toward the Pacific. And we want to be, you know, Wayne, let me give you a Wayne Gretzky. I’m all over the map today with my eclectic quotations here, from St. Augustine to Wayne Gretzky. I don’t know what’s going on. Wayne Gretzky, about your size, probably the best hockey player in history, we could debate that, I suppose. But somebody said to him once, you know, you’re not really a physically imposing guy. How do you, how come you were such a great hockey player? And he said, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it’s been.” That’s what we’re trying to do.\n","Q: General, obviously you talked a lot about reintegrating soldiers coming back from deployment. How do you think higher education at colleges, universities such as K State, play a role in that? What steps do you think colleges have allowed soldiers to maybe go back and earn a degree and -- and have a greater access to the job market and how -- how that helps them reintegrate? And what steps do you think need to be taken by higher… education?\n","Dempsey: Yeah, one of the, I think that first of all, I think the partnership with higher education is… terrific. I mean, I -- I couldn’t be more pleased with every place I go, higher education is -- is seeking to -- to increase the degree to which we partner with each other. I think we’ve got to do a little, I think we both have some work to do. I think we’ve got to do a little better job of preparing our veterans to -- to move into that environment.\n","Remember what I said about, you know, a veteran coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan goes from, you know, life at Mach 4 to something far slower and -- and somewhat more muted, and I -- and I think that, when I look at how we prepare veterans to move into -- into this civilian society and into education in particular, there’s some work we can do.\n","We -- We just did, with the Veterans Administration, revise our transition programs. And I think they’ll be -- they’ll be better, and we’ll continue to adapt them as necessary, at preparing veterans to enter academia. On the part of -- of academia, I think you have to understand that they’re not high school kids coming out of senior year and matriculating into a normal academic experience. They, first of all, they come with -- they come with some incredible strengths, they come with some vulnerabilities because of all the things I just mentioned. And there are some organizations, veteran support organizations, that are kind of growing up around the country that let’s call it mentor these young men and women that come into higher education, because our –- because our drop-out rate’s too high right now. And so I think we need to, we need a little help, and we need do to some things ourselves.\n","Q: Hello, sir. My name is Kristy Robinson. I’m the widow of Sergeant Jessie Earl Robinson, and I’m also a student at K State. I’m getting a dual major in mathematics and secondary education. And my concern today is about that there are many of our service members and veterans who return home and suffer PTSD, and when this is left untreated, it often results in a suicide, as was the case with my husband. And I was wondering, what can the nation or our communities and the military do to better treat and help our soldiers and veterans and help take care of their families, you know, as the soldiers are dealing with the post-traumatic stress, anxiety and reintegration issues?\n","Dempsey: Yeah. Well, first of all, I’m deeply sorry for your loss, and I thank you profoundly for stepping forward to tell us your story. How about we all give her a round of applause?\n","The effort in PTSD is -- is one of those issues where we have to be on a campaign of learning. So if we were to have this conversation ten years ago, we were trying to increase the, we still are trying to increase the protection at the point of impact. You know, we’re putting mechanical devices on helmets that sense that, you know, pressure from blast effects. That’s part of it. We’re also partnering with, by the way, with the National Football League and other sports experts to try to understand how to reduce the impact.\n","But then there’s some medicine and chemistry. A good friend of mine, Pete Chiarelli, who I was supposed to meet for dinner tomorrow, is on a campaign, you probably know Pete Chiarelli, at least you know him by name, he was the Vice Chairman, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, and probably our most, our -– our most active, passionate advocate for the study of PTSD and how to map it, how to understand it, you know, because it is… how to reduce the stigma, all the things that I’m sure you could speak to me about far more eloquently than I can speak to you.\n","In the time available, what I will tell you is we are absolutely seized with -- with PTSD, moderate traumatic brain injury and suicide, as well as some other things, and -- and the effects of prolonged, repeated conflict. Suicide in particular, though, is not uniquely a military challenge, as you well know. But I promise you, we are not, we’re not complacent about this. We are seized with it. And I really do appreciate you giving me the opportunity to… assure you of that. Thank you.\n","Q: General, thank you for being here. Going along with what she said, to the men in service, to the servicemen and women that are returning from deployment to civilian population, what do you think we as a society could help them cope better into emerging into civilian population again?\n","Dempsey: No, that’s a great question. It’s the conversation I’m hoping to start. I mean, the conversation has started. Maybe what I’m trying to do is turn the volume up a little bit, because, you know, we’re, Iraq is -- is no longer our fight. The Iraqi people, the Iraqi security forces have taken that on for themselves. Afghanistan will soon do the same. And we’ll have more veterans back in this country transitioning out. The budget reductions we talk about will likely, no, not likely, it will create more veterans. And so I want to have that conversation now before this all begins to happen in big numbers.\n","And I don’t know the answer. I… and in fact, I’ve studied it. I’ve read, I mean, I’m a pretty voracious reader. I’m trying to read everything that veterans are saying. I can’t get it all. There’s even some novelists that are, meaning literary authors who are taking this up. There’s a book I just read called “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” that’s kind of a, I’m not, by the way, this is not a promotion for the book, but it’s actually, it’s kind of the, “Catch” if you remember the book “Catch-22” and Vietnam, this is kind of “Catch-22” for the past ten years. It’s pretty interesting. I don’t agree with all of it, but I want to understand it, and I want you to be part of the conversation.\n","And, you know, it, this is kind of one of those places where we all say thanks to them, but how much, you know, how -- how often do we take the time to ask them to share their experiences, or how -- how often are you willing to share your experiences? I think we have to have a conversation, because look, this isn’t about forming an image of the veteran for us. This is about forming an image of the veteran for America, because every generation does that. And it’s now time for us to do that. And I really want the image to be positive. And so, because it should be positive. So I need your help. I can’t answer the question for you, but I need your help in answering it.\n","Moderator: We’ll be able to take one last question. Q: Thank you. My question picks up on the line of conversation from the last question. And I don’t know if there’s a ready answer for it, but I’m wondering when you try to picture what military leaders could do to help corporate and industrial partners transition from a wartime economy to an economy of peace, what are some of the things you think can be done?\n","Dempsey: Well, it, since it’s the 21st century, one of the premises I have is that our ability to connect should be a heck of a lot more, it should be a lot more possible for us to make the kind of connections you’re talking about in this century than it was in the last century. That’s -- that’s a given.\n","And so leveraging, I think, technology to share some common appreciation and understanding of -- of where these young men and women are, what they, I mean, I’m trying to transition the -- the personnel system of our military, this is kind of my challenge, which is kind of industrial age, you know, and the -- the ability of the young men or women to kind of have a hand in crafting their career differently than we have had in the past is possible today given technology. So I’m trying to, that by the way, this is hard -– this is hard government work.\n","But on the other side, I think there’s some, there are some opportunities. I think public-private partnerships tend to work better than to expect me or the government to do everything top-down. The -- The most successful programs for helping veterans, for -- for even for things like our acquisition strategies are generally public-private partnerships and -- and almost always grow from the bottom up. I think, I just have this sense that if I -- if I challenge you and challenge America to help me figure this out, I think the tools are there to figure it out, but I can’t do it by myself.\n","Moderator: When was it that you went to a talk and the theme was from The Who and you had quotes from St. Augustine and Wayne Gretzky? I think we have heard a very insightful view into the actions of our military, and you have answered so many wonderful questions. I thank the audience for those. Would you all join me in thanking General Dempsey? \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," i'm honored to be here on the one year anniversary -- anniversary. if you're here in uniform stand up, let's try that again. for those of you currently serving, duty first! \"i was with the Big Red One in Afghanistan last month\" --------------------------\n","599 \n","Original text: Mr. Meza: Due to the press of time we should begin immediately with the question and answer period. You know the ground rules; are there any questions?\n","Question: Senator Kennedy, I'm Glenn Norman, Pastor of Second Baptist Church in Corpus Christi. I think I speak for many that do not in any sense discount or in any sense doubt your loyalty and your love to this nation, or your position, that's in accord with our position, in regard to the separation of church and state. But could I bring it down to where we stand right here tonight, as two men of just nearly equal in age, just standing facing each other. If this meeting tonight were being held in the sanctuary of my church -- it's the policy in my city, that has many very fine Catholics in it, but it's the policy of Catholic leadership to forbid them to attend a Catholic -- a Protestant service -- If we tonight were in the sanctuary of my church, just right as we are, would you and could you attend, as you have here?\n","Senator Kennedy: Well, yes, I could. I can attend any -- as I said in my statement -- I would attend any service in the interest -- that had any connection with my public office, or, in the case of a private ceremony, weddings, funerals and so on, of course I would participate and have participated. I think the only question would be whether I could participate as a participant, a believer in your faith, and maintain my membership in my church. That, it seems to me, comes within the private beliefs that a Catholic might have. But as far as whether I could attend this sort of a function in your church, whether I as Senator or President could attend a function in your service connected with my position of office, then I could attend and would attend.\n","Question: Closely allied to it was the position in regard to the Chapel of the Chaplains that was dedicated and which I believe you once had accepted the invitation to attend, and then the press said, I believe, that Cardinal Dougherty brought pressure and you refused and did not attend.\n","Senator Kennedy: I will be delighted to explain. That seems to be a matter of great interest. I was invited in 1947, after my election to the Congress, by Dr. Poling to attend a -- a dinner to raise funds for an interfaith chapel in honor of the four chaplains who went down on the Dorchester. This was 14 years ago. I was delighted to accept, because I thought it was a useful and worthwhile cause. A few days before I was due to accept, I learned through my administrative assistant, who had friends in Philadelphia -- two things.\n","First, that I was listed -- and this is in Dr. Poling's book in which he describes the incident -- as the spokesman for the Catholic faith at the dinner. Charles Taft, Senator Taft's brother, was to be the spokesman for the Protestant faith. Senator Lehman was to be the spokesman for the Jewish faith.\n","The second thing I learned was that the chapel, instead of being located as I thought it was as an interfaith chapel, was located in the basement of another church. It was not in that sense an interfaith chapel, and for the 14 years since that chapel was built there has never been a service of my church because of the physical location. I, therefore, informed Dr. Poling that while I would be glad to come as a citizen, in fact, many Catholics did go to the dinner, I did not feel that I had very good credentials to attend as the spokesman for the Catholic faith at that dinner to raise funds when the whole Catholic church group in Philadelphia were not participating and because the chapel has never been blessed or consecrated.\n","Now I want to make it clear that my grounds for not going were private. I had no credentials to speak for the Catholic faith at a dinner for a chapel which has never -- in which no Catholic service has ever been held. So that -- and to this day, unfortunately, no service has been held at the present time. But I think if I may separate that, if this were a public matter, I told Dr. Poling I'd be glad to go as an individual; but I could not go as a spokesman on that occasion.\n","Question: Senator Kennedy, Canon Rutenbahr of Christ Church, here in Houston. I have read this platform and the planks in it with great interest, especially in the realms of freedom, and I note that in the educational section the right of education for each person is guaranteed or offered for a guarantee. It also says that there shall be equal opportunity for employment. In another section it says there shall be equal rights to housing and recreation.\n","All of these speak, I think, in a wonderful sense to the freedom which we want to keep here in America. Yet, on the other hand, there is in another place in the platform, I these words: \"We will repeal the authorization for right-to-work laws.\" Now, it seems to me that in this aspect here, and I feel that these are much more important than any religious issue -- here you are abolishing an open shop; you are taking away the freedom of the individual worker, whether he wants to work and wants to belong to this union or not. Now, isn't this sort of double talk? You're guaranteeing freedom on one hand and yet you're going to take it away on the other?\n","Senator Kennedy: No, I don't agree with that.\n","Question: I think there's a dichotomy here in the platform ... --\n","Senator Kennedy: Well that provision has been in the platform since 1948, and I am sure there is a difference of opinion between us on that matter, and between many Democrats on that matter. But I think that it's a decision which goes to the economic and political views. I don't think it involves a constitutional guarantee of freedom. In other words, under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley law, a State was permitted to prohibit a union shop. But it was not permitted to guarantee a closed shop.\n","Now, my own judgment is that uniformity in interstate commerce is valuable, and, therefore, I hold with the view that it's better to have uniform laws and not a law which is in interstate commerce, and these are all -- this is not intrastate but interstate commerce -- which permits one condition in one State and another in another. This is not a new provision. It's been in for the last three platforms.\n","Question: Max Dalcke, president of Gulf Coast Bible College, and pastor of First Church of God here in Houston, and I am a member, Mr. Meza, of the Houston Association of Ministers. Mr. Kennedy, you very clearly stated your position tonight in regard to the propagation of the gospel by all religious groups in other countries. I appreciated that much because we Protestants are a missionary people. However, the question I have to ask is this: If you are elected President, will you use your influence to get the Roman Catholic countries of South America and Spain to stop persecuting Protestant missionaries and to give equal rights to Protestants to propagate their faith as the United States gives to the Roman Catholics or any other group?\n","Senator Kennedy: I would use my influence as President of the United States to permit, to encourage the development of freedom all over the world. One of the rights which I consider to be important is the right of free speech, the right of assembly, the right of free religious practice, and I would hope that the United States and the President would stand for those rights all around the globe without regard to geography or religion or political traditions.\n","Question: Senator Kennedy, this is E. H. Westmoreland, pastor of the South Main Baptist Church, here in Houston. I have received today a copy of a resolution passed by the Baptist Pastors Conference of St. Louis, and they're going to confront you with this tomorrow night. I would like you to answer to the Houston crowd before you get to St. Louis. This is the resolution:\n","With deep sincerity and in Christian grace, we plead with Senator John F. Kennedy, as the person presently concerned in this matter, to appeal to Cardinal Cushing, Mr. Kennedy's own hierarchical superior in Boston, to present to the Vatican Mr. Kennedy's sincere statement relative to the separation of Church and State in the United States and religious freedom as represented in the Constitution of the United States, in order that the Vatican may officially authorize such a belief for all Roman Catholics in the United States.\n","Senator Kennedy: May I just say that as I do not accept the right of any, as I said, ecclesiastical official, to tell me what I shall do in the sphere of my public responsibility as an elected official, I do not propose also to ask Cardinal Cushing to ask the Vatican to take some action. I do not propose to interfere with their free right to do exactly what they want.\n","There is no doubt in my mind that the viewpoints that I have expressed -- there is no doubt in my mind that the viewpoint that I have expressed tonight publicly represents the opinion of the overwhelming majority of American Catholics, and I think that what my view I have no doubt is known to Catholics around the world. I am just hopeful that by my stating it quite precisely, and I believe I state it in the tradition of the American Catholics, way back all the way to Bishop John Carroll, I feel that -- I hope this will clarify it without my having to take the rather circuitous route. This is the position I take with the American Catholic Church in the United States with which I am associated.\n","Question: We appreciate your forthright statement. May I say we have great admiration for you. But until we know this is the position of your church, because there will be many Catholics who will be appointed if you are elected President, we would like to know that they, too, are free to make such statements as you've been so courageous to make.\n","Senator Kennedy: Well let me say that anyone that I would appoint to any office as a Senator or as a President, would, I hope, hold the same view of the necessity of their living up to not only the letter of the Constitution but the spirit. If I may say so, I am a Catholic. I've stated my view very clearly. I don't find any difficulty in stating that view. In my judgment, it is the view of American Catholics from one end of the country to the other. Because as long as I can state it in a way which is, I hope, is satisfactory to you, why do you possibly doubt that I represent a viewpoint which is hostile to the Catholic Church in the United States. I believe I'm stating the viewpoint that Catholics in this country hold toward the happy relationship which exists between Church and State.\n","Question: Let me ask you then, sir: Do you state it with the approval of the Vatican?\n","Senator Kennedy: I don't have to have approval in that sense. I've not submitted -- I have not submitted my statement before I read it to the Vatican. I did not submit it to Cardinal Cushing. But my judgment is that Cardinal Cushing, which is the Cardinal from the diocese of which I am a member, would approve of this statement, in the same way that he approved of the 1948 statement of the Bishop.\n","In my judgment, and I am not a student of theology, I am stating what I believe to be the position of my personal position and also the position of the great majority of Catholics across the United States. I hope that other countries may some day enjoy the same happy relationship of a separation between Church and State, whether they are in Catholic countries or non-Catholic countries. It seems to me that I am the one that is running for the office of the Presidency and not Cardinal Cushing and not anyone else.\n","Westmoreland: We would like very much for the Cardinal to make the same statement.\n","Question: *Senator Kennedy, I am K. O. White, pastor of Houston's Downtown First Baptist Church and former pastor of Metropolitan Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. Let me return for a moment to the matter of the Chaplain's Chapel because there will be some questions raised, I am sure, and we would like to have just a little further statement from you.* Today I had a telephone conversation with Dr. Poling and received this telegram from him. I'm sure you would like to clear this matter up. Let me read briefly from his telegram:\n","The 'Memorandum on Religion as an Election Issue' prepared by Senator Kennedy's associates has a section on the Poling incident. This section contains serious factual errors. I believe the Senator will wish to correct the errors or that he would will wish to withdraw that section. The original draft of the program on the interfaith dinner held in the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, on December 15, 1947, identified Mr. Kennedy, then Congressman from Massachusetts, as Honorable John F. Kennedy, Congressman from Massachusetts. Mr. Kennedy was never invited as an official representative of a religious organization nor indeed as the spokesman for the Catholic faith. No speaker on that occasion, Catholic, Jew, or Protestant, was identified by his faith. When two days before the dinner occasion Mr. Kennedy cancelled his engagement, he expressed his regret and grief and stated that since his Eminence, the Cardinal, requested him not to come, he as a loyal son of the church had no other alternative. Therefore, it was necessary to destroy this first program and to reprint it.\n","Senator Kennedy: Now I will state again that the words I used are a quotation from the -- from the Reverend Poling's book, \"Spokesman for the Catholic Faith,\" a book which was produced about a year ago which first discussed this incident.\n","Secondly, my memory of the incident is quite clear. In fact, it's as good as Rev. Poling's because when the matter was first discussed Reverend Poling stated that the incident took place in 1950, and it's only in the last two months that it has come forward that the incident took place in 1947.\n","Thirdly, I never discussed the matter with Cardinal Dougherty in my life. I've never spoken to the Cardinal. I first learned of it through Mr. Reardon, who was my administrative assistant, who knew a Mr. Doyle who worked for the National Catholic Welfare Conference, who stated that there was a good deal of concern among many of the church people in Philadelphia, because of the location of the chapel and because no service would ever be held in it because it was located in the basement of another church. It was an entirely different situation than the one that I had confronted when I first happily accepted it.\n","Now there were three speakers. Kennedy was one of them; Taft was the second; Senator Lehman was the third. I don't think I've misstated that one was supposed to speak for the Catholic faith, as a spokesman in Mr. Poling's words, one for the Protestant faith, and one and one for the Jewish faith. Now all I can I can say to you, sir, is this chapel -- I was glad to accept the invitation. I did not clear the invitation with anyone. It was only when I was informed that I was speaking, and I was invited obviously as a serviceman because I came from a prominent Catholic family, that I was informed that I was there really in a sense without any credentials. The chapel, as I have said, has never had a Catholic service. It is not an interfaith chapel. And therefore, for me to participate as a spokesman in that sense for the Catholic faith I think would have given an erroneous impression.\n","Now, I've been there 14 years. This took place in 1947. I had been in politics probably two months and was relatively inexperienced. I should have inquired before getting into the incident. Is this the best that can be done after 14 years? Is this the only incident that can be shown? And this was a private dinner. This was not a public dinner. This was a private dinner. This did not involve my responsibilities as a public official. My judgment was bad only in accepting it without having all the facts, which I wouldn't have done at a later date. But I do want to say that I've been there for 14 years.\n","I have voted on hundreds of matters, probably thousands of matters, which involve all kinds of public questions, some of which border on the relationship between Church and State. And quite obviously that record must be reasonably good or we wouldn't keep hearing about the Poling incident. In addition, I don't mean to be disrespectful to the Reverend Poling. I have high regard for his son. I have high regard for Dr. Poling. I don't like to be in a debate with him about it. But I must say, even looking back, I think it was imprudent of me to accept it without more information, but I don't really feel that it demonstrates unfitness to hold public office.\n","Question: The reason for our concern is the fact that your church has stated that it has the privilege and the right and the responsibility to direct its members in various areas of life, including the political realm. We believe that history and observation indicate that it has done so. And we raise the question because we would like to know, if you are elected President and your church elects to use that privilege and obligation, what your response will be under those circumstances.\n","Senator Kennedy: If my church attempted to influence me in a way which was improper or which affected adversely my responsibilities as a public servant, sworn to uphold the Constitution, then I would reply to them that this was an improper action on their part, that it was one to which I could not subscribe, that I was opposed to it, and that it would be an unfortunate breach of -- an interference, with the American political system. I'm confident that there would be no such interference. We've had two Chief Justices of the Supreme Court who were Catholics. We've had three Prime Ministers of Canada in this century. I've already mentioned Mr. De Gaulle and Mr. Adenauer. My judgment is that an American who is a Catholic, who is as sensitive as a Catholic must be who seeks this high office, has exposed to the pressures which whirl around us, that he will be extremely diligent in his protection of the constitutional separation.\n","White: We would be most happy to have such a statement from the Vatican.\n","Mr. Meza: Because of the brief -- briefness of the time, let's cut out the applause.\n","Question: Senator Kenney: B. E. Howard, minister of the Church of Christ. First of all I should like to quote some authoritative quotations from Catholic sources and then propose a question. \"So that a false statement knowingly made to one who has not a right to the truth will not be a lie\" (Catholic Encyclopedia, volume 10, page 696). Quoting: \"However, we are also under an obligation to keep secrets faithfully and sometimes the easiest way of fulfilling that duty is to say what is false or tell a lie\" (Catholic Encyclopedia, volume 10, page 195). \"When mental reservation is permissible, it is lawful to corroborate one's utterances by an oath if there be an adequate cause\" (Article on perjury, Catholic Encyclopedia, volume 11, page 696). \"The truth we proclaim under oath is relative and not absolute\" (Explanation of Catholic Morals,\" page 130).\n","Just recently from the Vatican in Rome this news release was given from the official Vatican newspaper -- and I am quoting that of May 19, 1960, Tuesday -- stated that the Roman Catholic hierarchy had the right and duty to intervene in the political field to guide its flock. The newspaper rejected what is termed (quoting) \"the absurd split of conscience between the believer and the citizen.\" However, Observatore Romano made it clear that its stern pronouncement was valid for Roman Catholic laymen everywhere. It deplored the great confusion of ideas that is spreading especially between Catholic doctrine and social and political activities and between the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the lay faithful in the civil field. Pope John XXIII recently gave this statement according to the St. Louis Review, dated December 12th, 1958 (quoting): \"Catholics may unite their strength toward the common aid and the Catholic hierarchy have the right and duty of guiding them\" --\n","From the floor: (objection...due to time)\n","Question: Question, sir: Do you subscribe to the doctrine of mental reservation which I have quoted from the Catholic authorities? Do you submit to the authority of the present Pope which I have quoted from in these quotations?\n","Senator Kennedy: Well, let me say in the first place I've not read the Catholic Encyclopedia and I don't know all the quotation which you're giving me. I don't agree with the statement. I find no difficulty in saying so. But I do think probably I could get a -- make a better comment if I had the entire quotation before me. But in any case I have not read it before. If the quotation is meant to imply that when you take an oath you don't mean it or that it's proper for you to make oaths and then break them, that it is proper for you to lie, if that is what this states, and I don't know whether that is what it states unless I read it all in context, then, of course, I would not agree with it.\n","Secondly, on the question of the Observatore Romano article, once again I don't have that in full. I read the statement of last December which was directed to a situation in Sicily where some of the Catholics were active in the Communist Party. But I'm not familiar with the one of May 1960 that you mentioned. In any case the Observatore Romano has no standing, as far as binding me. Thirdly, this quotation of Pope John of 1958, I didn't catch all of that, and if you'll read that again I will tell you whether that -- I feel whether I support that or not.\n","Question: Pope John XXIII only recently stated according to the St. Louis Review, date of December 12th, 1958 (quoting), \"Catholics must unite their strength toward the common aid and the Catholic hierarchy has the right and duty of guiding them.\" Do you subscribe to that?\n","Senator Kennedy: Well, now, what I -- I couldn't describe -- guiding them in what area? If you're talking about in the area of faith and morals, in the constructions of the church, I would think any Baptist minister or Congregational minister has the right and duty to try to guide his flock. If you mean that by that statement that the Pope or anyone else could bind me in the fulfillment, by a statement, in the fulfillment of my public duties, I say no.\n","If that statement is intended to mean, and it's very difficult to comment on a sentence taken out of an article which I have not read, but if that is intended to imply that the hierarchy has some obligation or has an obligation to attempt to guide the members of the Catholic Church, then that may be proper. But it all depends on the previous language of what you mean by \"guide.\" If you mean direct or instruct on matters dealing with the organization of the faith, the details of the faith, then, of course, they have that obligation. If you mean that by that -- under that he could guide me or anyone could guide or direct me in fulfilling my public duty, then I do not agree.\n","Question: Thank you, sir. Then you do not agree with the Pope in that statement?\n","Senator Kennedy: You see, that is why I was -- wanted to be careful, because that statement, it seems to me, is taken out of context that you just made to me. I could not tell you what the Pope meant unless I had the entire article. I would be glad to state to you that no one can direct me in the fulfillment of my duties as a public official under the United States Constitution. That I am directed to do to the people of the United States, sworn to do, to an oath to God. Now that is my flat statement. I would not want to go into details on a sentence that you read to me which I may not understand completely.\n","Question: I understand you didn't explain anything.\n","Mr. Meza: Gentlemen we have time -- we have time for one more question, if it can be handled briefly.\n","Question: Senator Kennedy, I'm Robert McLaren, from Westminster Presbyterian Church, here in Houston. You have been quite clear, and I think laudably so, on this matter of the separation of Church and State, and you have answered very graciously the many questions that have come up around it. There is one question, however, which seems to me quite relevant. And this relates to your statement that if you found by some remote possibility a real conflict between your oath of office as President, that you would resign that office if it were in real conflict with your church.\n","Senator Kennedy: No, I said with my conscience.\n","Question: With your conscience. In the syllabus of errors of Pope Leo IX, which the Catholic Encyclopedia states is still binding, although it's from a different century, is still binding upon all Catholics, there are three very specific things which are denounced, including the separation of State and Church, the freedom of religions other than Catholic to propagate themselves, and the freedom of conscience. Do you still feel, these being binding upon you, that you hold your oath of office above your allegiance to the Pope on these issues?\n","Senator Kennedy: Well, let's go through the issues because I don't think there's a conflict on these three issues. The first issue, as I understand it, was on the relationship between the Catholics and the state and other faiths. Was that the --\n","Question: No, the separation of Church and State, he explicitly considers in error.\n","Senator Kennedy: I support that, and in my judgment the American Bishops statement of 1948 clearly supported it. That, in my judgment, is the view held by Catholics in this country. They support the constitutional separation of Church and State and they are not in error in that regard.\n","Question: The second was the right of religions other than Roman Catholic to propagate themselves.\n","Senator Kennedy: I think that they should be permitted to propagate themselves, any faith, without any limitation by the power of the State, or encouragement by the power of the State. What's the third one?\n","Question: The third was the freedom of conscience in matters of religion, and this also in point 46, I believe it is, extends to the freedom of the mind in the realms of science. This is part --\n","Senator Kennedy: Yes, well, I believe in freedom of conscience. Let me just -- I guess our time is coming to an end, but I believe in it. Let me say, finally, that I am delighted to come here today. I don't want anyone to think because they interrogate me on this very important question, that I regard that as unfair questions or unreasonable or somebody who is concerned about the matter is prejudiced or bigoted. I think this fight for religious freedom is basic in the establishment of the American system, and therefore any candidate for the office, I think, should submit himself to the questions of any reasonable man.\n","My only objection would be -- my only limit to that would be that if somebody said regardless of Senator Kennedy's position, regardless of how much evidence he's given that what he says he means, I still wouldn't vote for him because he is a member of that church. I would consider that unreasonable. What I consider to be reasonable, and an exercise of free will and free choice, is to ask the candidate to state his views as broadly as possible, investigate his record to see what whether he states he believes and then to make an independent rational judgment, as to whether he could be entrusted with this highly important position. So I want you to know that I'm grateful to you for inviting me tonight. I'm sure that I have made no converts to my church. But I do hope -- I do hope that at least my view, which I believe to be the view of my fellow Catholics, who hold office, I hope that it may be of some value in at least assisting you to make a careful judgment.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," senator: \"i can attend any service in the interest that had any connection with my public office\" he says the only question would be whether I could participate as a participant in your church. --------------------------\n","600 \n","Original text: Mr. Davis, Mr. Waxman, Congressmen:\n","Twenty short months ago our youngest son, Taylor, took his own life. He was two weeks away from beginning his senior year in high school. He was carrying a 3.8 average, made excellent scores on his SAT tests, and he and I were preparing to make college visits.\n","Taylor was well liked by all who knew him. Adults tell us he was one of the nicest young men they ever knew -- extremely well-mannered. His [teachers] thought he was one of the nicest kids on campus, a real ladies' man, quite a charmer.\n","This past spring, Taylor would have been a starting pitcher on his varsity baseball team. But during the fall of his junior year, his JV coach told this 6'3, 175 pound young man that he needed to get bigger in order to improve his chances of making the varsity team.\n","Taylor resorted to using anabolic steroids to help him achieve his objective. And like the Garibaldis, I am absolutely convinced that Taylor's secret use of anabolic steroids played a significant role in causing the depression -- the severe depression -- that resulted in his suicide. And I've also learned that the events leading up to and including Taylor's suicide are right out of the medical textbook on steroids.\n","Experts put the usage of steroids amongst our high school kids at about 5 to 6 percent of the overall population. Some of the experts I talk to use numbers more like a million kids doing steroids -- not 500,000 -- and I'm of a personal belief that those numbers are the bottom end of the range, that that number's higher. In some parts of the country studies show that the usage amongst high school junior and senior males is as high as 11 to 12 percent. Let me put that in context The kids in my part of the country tell me that as many as 1/3 of the boys that show up to play football under the lights on Friday night are juicing.1\n","A number of factors are contributing to the increasing usage amongst our kids. You've asked me to talk about one of them, and I'm happy to do that. I believe that the poor example being set by professional athletes is a major catalyst fueling the high usage of steroids amongst our kids. Our kids look up to these guys. They want to do the things the pros do to be successful. And with this in mind I have several messages for the professional athletes.\n","First, I am sick and tired of having you tell us that your -- you don't want to be considered role models. If you haven't figured it out yet, let me break the news to you that whether you like it or not -- you are role models. And parents across America should hold you accountable for behavior that inspires our kids to do things that put their health at risk, and that teaches them that the ethics we try to teach them around our kitchen table somehow don't apply to them.\n","Second, our kids know that the use of anabolic steroids is high amongst professional athletes. They don't need to read Mr. Canseco's new book to know that something other than natural physical ability is providing many of you with the ability to break so many performance records, that provide you with the opportunity to make those millions of dollars. Our youngsters hear the message loud and clear -- and it's wrong: If you would want to achieve your goal, it's okay to use steroids to get you there because the pros are doing it. It's a real challenge for parents to overpower the strong message that's been sent -- that's being sent to our children by your behavior.\n","Third, players that [sic] are guilty of taking steroids are not only cheaters -- you are cowards! You're afraid to step on the field to compete for your positions and play the game without the aid of substances that are a felony to possess without a legitimate prescription -- substances that have been banned from competition at all levels of athletics. Not only that: You are cowards when it comes to facing your fans and our children. Why don't you behave like we try to teach our kids to behave? Show our kids that you're man enough to face authority, tell the truth, and face the consequences. Instead, you hide behind the skirts of your union. And with the help of management and your lawyers, you've made every effort to resist facing the public today.\n","What message are you sending our sons and daughters? That your above the law? That you can continue to deny your behavior and get away with it? That somehow you're not a cheater unless you get caught?\n","Your attorneys say they're worried about how your public testimony might play in a court of law. But how do you think your refusals to talk are playing in the court of public opinion? Let me tell you that the national jury of young people have already judged your actions and concluded that many of you are guilty of using illegal performance enhancing drugs. But instead of convicting you, they have decided to follow your lead. And in tens of thousands of homes across America, our 16 and 17-year-old children are injecting themselves with anabolic steroids -- just like you big-leaguers do.\n","Your union leaders want us to be sensitive to your right of privacy. Right to privacy? What about our rights as parents -- our rights to expect that the adults that our kids all look up to will be held to a standard that does not include behavior that is dangerous, felonious, and is cheating?\n","How about a short message for management? We can't leave them out. Major league baseball and other sports need to take serious steps to stop the use of -- of steroids. Slapping a player on the wrist with a 10-day suspension -- I didn't even know about the 10,000 dollar [fine] until this morning -- but a 10-day suspension is just one more signal to our children that you're not serious about ridding the game of this junk. Forcing a prey -- pro, even at worst to miss 10 games, is asking him to mix -- miss 6 percent of a season. Let's put that through the prism of the glasses of a high school student. Forcing a high school student to miss 6 percent of his season is asking him to sit the bench for less than one game.\n","And we shouldn't be talking about whether or not to put asterisks next to these guys' records. They ought to be thrown out of baseball, and we ought to be turning them over to the authorities to have them arrested and put in jail for the behavior that they've done.\n","Why don't you implement a program that we've heard about today, that's a lot closer to the Olympic standard, where cheaters are not able to compete for 2 years after their first offense, and banned for life following the second. Just maybe, our kids will get the message that you're finally serious about solving this problem.\n","Let me add to the whole discussion that this is not about a collective bargaining agreement. Guys, we are way past that. Steroid usage has become a major health issue and -- that is affecting the lives and health of our kids, and I encourage the members of congress to please deal with it in such a manner.\n","A critical weapon that we have in this...battle is education.\n","Out students need to know that these drugs can seriously harm them. But I'm convinced that trying to warn 16-year-olds about the danger of liver cancer or having a heart attack -- probably going to fall on deaf ears, which is why I believe our first targets for education have to be our parents and our coaches.\n","Our parents need to know the dangers of this drug, how to recognize the warning sign, and understand the importance of supervising this with our kids.\n","Our coaches have to be more responsible and accountable for dealing with this situation with their teams. Coaches across the country need to be certified and credentialed -- to have to pass a test to prove that they are competent to supervise our children. As part of the certification, they need to be trained about steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, and trained to know what to do about it when they find it. And finally, they need to be held accountable for ensuring that their teams are steroid-free.\n","To help fill the education void, we have formed the Taylor Hooton Foundation for fighting steroid abuse, the nation's first private organization in this area. Working in conjunction with doctor-experts, like Dr. Gary Wadler here on my left, we would like to explore ways to work with you and others in the government to make your -- our foundation part of your work going forward.\n","On behalf of my son Taylor Hooton, Rob Garibaldi, and Efrain Marrero, whose parents are with us today, let me implore you to take steps to clean up this mess. Please help us to see that our children's lives were not lost in vain. You have the power to do something about it and we're counting on you to do so.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," a number of factors are contributing to the increasing usage of steroids amongst our kids. some experts say that the usage among high school junior and senior males is as high as 11 to 12 percent of the overall population. john sutter: i'm convinced that Taylor's secret use of anabolic steroids played an important role in causing the depression that resulted in his suicide. --------------------------\n","601 \n","Original text: Hello everyone.\n","We are a country that stands united in our effort to defeat a pandemic, to save lives, and to help each other make it to a better day.\n","But yesterday, we were jolted from that common cause by the senseless violence and tragedy in Nova Scotia.\n","A gunman claimed the lives of at least 18 people, among them a woman in uniform whose job it is to protect lives even if it endangers her own: Constable Heidi Stevenson of the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police].\n","Constable Stevenson died protecting others. She was answering the call of duty, something she had done every day when she went to work for 23 years.\n","This happened in small towns. Portapique, Truro, Milford, and Enfield are places where people have deep roots; places where people know their neighbors and look out for one another. There, everyone knows a Mountie because they’re everything from police officers to social workers to teen counselors. Now these communities are in mourning and Canada is in mourning with them. To the grandparent who lost a child, the children who lost a parent, to the neighbor who lost a friend -- we are so sorry for your loss. Such a tragedy should’ve never occurred. Violence of any kind has no place in Canada. We stand with you and we grieve with you, and you can count on our government’s full support during this incredibly painful time.\n","I also want to wish a full and speedy recovery to all those injured, including another RCMP officer.\n","Canada is a vast and sweeping country, filled with long stretches of lonely roads. With unwavering courage and compassion, our Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol these roads to keep us safe, as they have for over a hundred years.\n","I know that from coast to coast to coast, the women and men who wear the Red Serge in service to Canada are grieving deeply the loss of one of their own -- and one of our best.\n","This tragedy is a painful reminder of the risks all of our first responders take to keep us safe, of the sacrifices they make every single day to protect our communities. Paramedics, doctors, nurses, firefighters, and police officers -- they’re always here for us.\n","They’ve been stepping up through the pandemic and yesterday, in Nova Scotia, they showed that bravery. I want to take a moment to thank them all for their professionalism and their courage.\n","Many of you are already working overtime because of this pandemic. Our communities need you now more than ever and I know that can weigh on you at times. These are exceptional circumstances, yet you did what you always do: You ran towards danger, without pause, without hesitation, you put your life on the line.\n","On behalf of all Canadians: Thank you for your service.\n","This day is made all the more difficult because of the precious lives lost and the senseless act of one person. Just how could this happen? We may never know why.\n","But we do know this: No one man’s action can build a wall between us and a better day -- no matter how evil, how thoughtless, or how destructive. Canadians are kind and generous. We are there for each other and we look out for one another. As families grieve the loss of a loved one, all Canadians are standing with them.\n","The pandemic will prevent us from mourning together in person, but a vigil will be held virtually to celebrate the lives of the victims at 7 p.m. on Friday through the Facebook group “Colchester -- Supporting our Communit[ies].”\n","As we learn more about what happened yesterday, it’s important that we come together to support communities. In the hours since the tragedy, I’ve spoken with Premier McNeil, RCMP Commissioner Lucki, Minister Blair, and many Nova Scotians, including our Nova Scotia caucus.\n","We will continue to work together to see this through. I know that people have a lot of questions. This is an ongoing investigation, but I can assure you that the RCMP and local authorities will keep you updated.\n","I want to ask the media to avoid mentioning the name and showing the picture of the person involved. Do not give him the gift of infamy. Let us instead focus all our intention and attention on the lives we lost, and the families and friends who grieve.\n","I want to close today by addressing all the kids in Nova Scotia and right across the country. I know the world can seem like a mean and ugly place right now, but there’s a whole lot of good in the world too. You’ll see it in your neighbors and in Canadians in the days and weeks and months ahead.\n","This is a difficult time -- and it can be a scary time too. But we’re here for you. And we’re going to get through this together.\n","I promise. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," a gunman claimed the lives of at least 18 people. the RCMP is in mourning with the deaths of dozens of people in the province of portapique, nevada, and san francisco. cnn's john mccartney is jolted from that common cause by the senseless violence and tragedy in Nova Scotia. --------------------------\n","602 \n","Original text: Okay, let’s get to work. I would like first to welcome all of you to ICANN 51. I have not -- some people asked me, “When do you take off your jacket and when you don’t?” So when I started with you, I used to always take off my jacket when I start and people said, “He is getting to work,” and I think I stopped taking my jacket during the year I was very busy talking to governments, but now we need to get back to work here at ICANN and get ICANN ready for the very important transition and journey we are about to take.\n","And let me start first by letting you know we have about 2,500 people who have registered for ICANN51. This is the largest ballroom we’ve ever had at an opening of ICANN. There are 12,000 seats here in this room. We have people registered from a little over 100 countries here. This is an impressive showing of global presence. So I want to take a moment to welcome each of you, all of you from everywhere you’ve come, especially those who have come from the farthest places. And I want to especially welcome the people who are here for the first time. So if you’re here for the first time, could you stand up so we’d get a sense of who’s here for the first ICANN meeting?\n","Welcome. Welcome. Welcome to your first ICANN meeting. I also want to welcome our fellows. Our Fellows Program is a cornerstone of building our community and growing it. So welcome to all the new ICANN fellows. I think we have 50 of them at this meeting, so welcome to all of you and I hope this meeting will encourage you to stay with us and to build your own place in ICANN as well as Internet history here with us at ICANN. So welcome to all of you. I also want to welcome all the dignitaries, the ministers that are here, you are very welcome at ICANN and we’re happy you can join us here today.\n","All right. We started a new season a couple of years ago when I came to ICANN, and I think we’re at kind of this third stage of this season. We worked hard to get the ground ready and we saw together how, as a community, we can start preparing for this very important next stage. Now, during this time, many important things have happened. Today marks the annual general meeting of ICANN. So once every year we meet and we assess how our year has been. So I’m going to take a moment to review the fiscal year 2014 which, for those of you who are new, our fiscal year starts on July 1st and just ended on June 30th of this year.\n","Now, during this fiscal year we had many historic milestones. Of course, the most important one that everyone is talking about is the decision of the US Government to transition the stewardship we’ve had of the IANA [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority] functions to our community. And you heard Secretary Pritzker today with great eloquence speak about the importance of this transition and the commitment the US Government has had to support ICANN and the commitment they will keep to ICANN and to the Internet governed the way we all want it to be governed in a multi-stakeholder way.\n","And I want to recognize at this moment one of the people that we talk about, all of us in the hallways, and in emails, and in many discussions but rarely, frankly, publicly thanked for his incredible leadership and that’s Assistant Secretary Larry Strickling who’s here with us today. Larry, with his able team, including Fiona Alexander who’s here as you all know her, are really the quiet champions of this transition. They are the people who trust us and who have brought together a difficult but important coalition to support this transition.\n","This is not easy to do. Many governments asked me, “Why would the US Government give up this?” “Why would any government give up power?” It’s not natural, but through the courage and leadership of Larry and his team and Secretary Pritzker’s support, and our President’s support here in the US, I think we are moving in the right direction. So we thank you for that very important milestone and now it’s incumbent upon us to take this huge responsibility we are being handed and to carry through and get this done.\n","However, that wasn’t the only thing that happened in 2014. So let me cover a few things. As you recall, we have a strategic plan and a framework that includes four objectives that we identified in the Toronto meeting back in 2012 when I started, and these are the four. Let me show you what we’ve done in 2014 on each of these four.\n","First affirmation of our purpose. And here, there are many numbers and facts. Let me focus on a couple. As you know, we have a very active group of community members that do the accountability recommendations. That team gave us a key recommendation to create better access to WHOIS information. And so in 2014, we introduced whois.icann.org. If you haven’t used it, please do. And whois.icann.org gives comprehensive information on how WHOIS works and the information behind it, and we‘re now -- we’ve gone from 200 when we started in November to 5,000 visitors a week from 200 countries. So this is clearly a tool that was needed, and we filled an important void.\n","Within that tool in April, we added consolidated WHOIS lookup. So you can go and put any website, any domain name in the world and find out the WHOIS information behind it. That again also has now gotten to 85,000 inquiries per month that are coming to this centralized consolidated lookup tool. We are glad we responded to the community’s requirement to improve our accountability and to add transparency to what ICANN does. Many of you here, 322 of you, saw your new gTLDs added to the root in 2014. Of course, that number is higher today because we are already in October, but that’s a very successful implementation of our core responsibilities.\n","I would also want to note on the right there that we train -- our staff goes around the world to train people on DNSSEC, the key security standard that we have and this -- in 2014, we trained an additional 280 people around the world to do that. So again, good progress in that area to strengthen who we are, and I want to, here publicly, thank our friends from Brazil. I see them, so please stand up -- Demi [Getschko]; Hartmut [Richard Glaser], and all the members of CGI who are here. Hartmut. The leadership they took to help us make NETmundial happen and I see there also Ambassador Benedicto [Fonseca Filho]. Thank you, Ambassador. And all of you there for helping us make history in Brazil. I think we will all remember that, and the partnership we have with you shall be for many years, I hope. Thank you very much.\n","Let me go to operations excellence. Now, this is an area where, admittedly, I will tell you we have more work to do, but let me at least highlight a few things and tell you what we are going to do to do more. The thing I‘m most proud of is that middle number which I shouldn’t be proud of, you should be proud of because we now do a thorough audit of compliance of all of our registers and registrars. And this is the second year we do it, and remarkably, not surprisingly, 98% of registers and registrars are fully compliant with their contracts. This independent audit shows what many of us know -- that this is a good industry. This is an industry that is operating in the best public interest. We should celebrate that. We should put that up and make sure people understand when a few bad actors sully the image of this industry, we should know that there are few and that our compliance department will be looking for these so that they do not make the rest of our industry look bad. Our industry is performing very well and the numbers are, this year, 98% in full compliance of our contractual commitments. Yes, thank you.\n","Our IANA functions which are the core of our responsibility. And especially important this year as we look at the transition, how are we doing? We are meeting and exceeding every service level we have in IANA, as you can tell from this bottom row. And I’m very proud of that [unclear] of the great IANA team that is continuing to function calmly, confidently despite the changing world around them, and I can assure you that they’re superbly ready as the US Government steps away from its role to continue doing what they do with distinction as they’ve done in 2014. Thank you, thank you, IANA team.\n","I think I’ll just point out also that we have now the L-root deployed in 158 locations around the world. This is the commitment of ICANN -- to improve response times by leveraging the fact that we are responsible for one of the 13 root services by bringing it to the world and, this year alone, we’ve added -- we went last year from 26 to a 38-location increase this year, so thank you for the L-root team at ICANN for that progress.\n","This little icon on the bottom called planning framework is very important. I do believe we have work to do still on our operations excellence. Excellence is never achieved but right now, frankly, I do not think we’re quite there. We have work to do. So, I will leave a discussion on the planning framework to a couple of slides down but I will come back to it because I want to share with you how the ICANN leadership team is building a new framework so we make sure we serve your needs in the best possible way.\n","The third of the four goals was internationalization. Now, we prefer to refer to it as globalization. What have we done there? The numbers on the right speak for themselves. The interest in what ICANN does has grown. That doesn’t mean that our KPI, our key performance indicator, is that these numbers keep growing. What is important is that globally we’re inclusive. We’re reaching out to all people who want to participate in ICANN’s mission, and making sure that our meetings and our activities reach them and bring them on board.\n","I am particularly proud of the number of newcomers, and the number of fellows because that shows that the ICANN community is growing also in new ways. On the slide, I want to point to the percentage growth of our staff. The percentage growth outside the United States is far outstripping the growth within the US, and this is by design. Our new hubs in Istanbul and Singapore and my wife in the room so I should be careful. She and I moved to these hubs during this year. It was not always easy, but we lived in Singapore for a while then we came back to the US and then we went to Istanbul so that we can support ICANN’s growth in these locations and make sure that our employees see us living and performing our functions around the world.\n","But this really shows we have reached an important inflection in where ICANN’s center of gravity is. Because, to a large degree, when I started, frankly, the center of gravity was here, was in the US. That’s changing. It’s a journey. It won’t happen overnight, but our hubs in these main geographic choices of Istanbul and Singapore are now well-established and the roots are there and the staff is growing and the functions are spread across our three hubs.\n","Now, we still have some work to do. For example, look at the website. We have done, I think, the best we could to advance the website but, clearly, we heard back from the community that there is more work to do. I can assure you we’re on it. Just three days ago, we’ve completely changed the search engine because many of you felt the search was weak. We now use new technology. But I want to point out something that I feel is very important. We have nearly 5,000 of you who built their profiles on that site. That’s important because the profile allows us to then start giving you the information you need and connecting you to others so we can create the expert networks within our community. So for those of you who haven’t done so yet, please do build your profiles. This is to help us be together and work better as a team.\n","I also think on the translation side, whilst the number of words we’ve translated has grown exponentially in 2014, reflecting the amount of work we do, I think our team is clear that translation is only part of localization. Localization is much more than just translating words, so we are preparing to enhance the services we offer you so we can localize the information and provide you better knowledge of what we’re doing.\n","Lastly, the evolution of our multi-stakeholder model. That’s you, that’s our community that’s bringing us together. So, all of these accomplishments are yours and the stakeholders. Specifically, I want to talk again about the GNSO and the great work that the councilors of this important body in ICANN have done under the leadership of Jonathan. His well-deserved award today is to reflect the sea change in how the GNSO is together and is working with all the other parts of the ICANN community. That’s important.\n","RSSAC has done something remarkable this year. They’ve gone from being a small community of root operators or root service operators to building this caucus where they invite other members of the technical community to join them, to participate with them in that caucus. In other words, removing sometimes the veil of what’s happening in the root community, they’ve opened up, invited others and are engaged in a very important dialogue. So, thank you to the new leadership in RSSAC. Liman, who is here I hope, has done a superb job with his other partners to open up the RSSAC for others.\n","I want to point out the At-Large community that has gone from giving us -- adding eight structures last year to adding 23 new At-Large structures in 2014. This is remarkable. I think our total now is 177 at-large structures around the world. What an impressive reach of the user community into ICANN. Not to mention their policy advice which continues to grow remarkably, they’re up to 53 policy advice statements this year.\n","The GAC is now at 141 members as of the end of June. 141 countries represented on GAC. In fact, the number today is higher even because we’re already in October. We have 31 observers from international governmental organizations. So, quite an impressive growth across our community. The ccNSO up to 150 now. The SSAC going again from 5 to 7 documents. That may sound like a small number but, believe me, every SSAC document that arrives to us is worth its weight in gold. The amount of work and research and thoughtfulness they put to advise us is very much appreciated. So, great work by our community across the board. Thank you for a great year.\n","Let’s look forward now. So, that strategic plan and the four objectives I showed you were very much started in 2012. Now, for the last 17 months, 17 months, when I shared this with my friends at places like IBM and I say we spent 17 months writing the new strategic plan, they don’t understand. I didn’t understand, but now I do. That unless we do this together from the bottom up, it is not our plan. It may be my plan. It may be the staff’s plan. It may be somebody’s idea. But the genius of ICANN, the magic of ICANN, is that we, in fact, spent together 17 months, 3 full comment periods to develop the next strategic plan of ICANN.\n","I am very proud of this new achievement and we should all be. And the plan, frankly, is one of the few things we delivered to our Board of Directors and unanimously, and you can ask them, they’re here, very supportive, very pleased with the outcome. If you have not read this plan, please do read it. It is on our website. It is an extensive plan that lays out where ICANN is going in the future. And it has very, very solid information.\n","At its core are five strategic objectives. Here they are. Now, we used to have four as I showed you before. We now have a fifth one. The four are changed, but somewhat similar. The fifth one there is a very important one and one, frankly, that I am sure you all are very proud of. We have added a specific objective to develop and implement a global public interest framework, of course, bounded by ICANN’s mission. ICANN does not want to grow into becoming a development agency. This is not what we do. But we have to root everything we do in the global public interest. So creating this framework is a huge step forward and one we are deeply committed to achieve as a community. Underneath these five strategic objectives in the plan that I just showed you, we have 16 goals, and now for the next five years, we will be using these in order to build our activities so that we are anchored where you want us to be.\n","Now, let’s talk a little bit about how we are going to go from five strategic objectives and 16 goals to the work we do everyday. So, I want to share with you a very important operational view of how we do this. As you can tell here, we start with the vision and mission statement and the strategic plan, these are all in this document which, by the way, will be voted on by the board in the public session this Thursday, because that’s it. We’ve finished the 17 months and the board will vote on these and they become part of the record. From there, we will build a five-year operating plan and by we, I mean we will build a five-year operating plan. We will put the first version of this plan out for you to review and give us input on immediately after this ICANN meeting. So, it’s ready, it’s been put together, and you will find it on our website. After we do that and we get your inputs, we will move into the annual operating plan and budget process. And then from there, we go to achievement and progress reporting which is, again, the cycle. And we, all of us a community, are in the middle. Everyone of these things goes through all of us. Nothing, nothing goes only through staff. Nothing goes only through Board. It has to come through all of us. So, the five-year operating plan will be put out for everyone’s input. We need you. Please help us with this because this is the foundation for how we build the yearly plans after that. And then we’ll do the yearly plan every year and, as usual, we’ll work with you on it and then we’ll do the achievement and progress report.\n","Let me dwell for a minute on the achievement and progress reporting. Remarkably, we do not have, as a community, common agreement on the scorecard of key performance indicators. We need that, so when people come up to me and say, “Fadi, operations are not quite there.” Well, how much farther do we need to go? Well, we don’t know because we don’t have an agreement on what are the frameworks. So, in this operating plan and the annual plan, we are going to be inserting, for the first time, a complete framework of key performance indicators and then we will measure these continuously, and we will share all that data with you continuously. So, when we have discussions, we are aligned on what we need to do to serve you in the best possible way.\n","Now, these KPIs are critical, and I’m looking at many of you here in the room that I know can really guide me and guide our staff in making sure we have the right performance indicators for you. Now, we are going to be adding a new thing, a new meeting -- and I’m sorry about that -- to the list of many ICANN meetings. We will do like most corporations do. They hold shareholders call on a quarterly basis. Well, we’re going to start holding a stakeholders call on a quarterly basis. The first one is on November 20th and we will be announcing it shortly because it’s after the end of our first fiscal quarter. Each of these calls will carry full information on our performance, financial, and business, and strategic, and we will share these in the context of the new plans as well as the new KPIs. So, please join us for these. This will be open. Everyone is welcome, including the press and others that need to start understanding the openness and transparency with which ICANN operates. So the first call will be on November 20th and the notice on that will be going out shortly.\n","A little more detail on what’s in these three components. It’s important you appreciate this because many of these things are new. ICANN has never had a five-year operating plan. This is the first time we do this, but the strategic plan, of course, includes our vision, mission, the five strategic objectives, and the 16 goals. And, of course, we have some strategic risks also outlined in that document. When we go to the five-year operating plan for each of the goals, we have the key performance indicators, the risks, the dependencies and, for the first time, the five-year phasing. In other words, what do we expect to do on this goal in a year? In two years? In three years? And so on and so forth, so you have a view of where we’re heading with each of these goals. Then we will list every portfolio of work we’re doing under each goal. And there are today about 50, 60 portfolios of work. We will fit them now under these five goals so you see what ICANN is doing in each of these areas.\n","The other thing we will put on the five-year plan which we have never done before is a five-year financial model. This is the first time ICANN will publish what its view is of the revenues, the top line, as well as the expenses for the next five years. And this is important so we are completely aligned as a community as to what is our financial view for the next five years.\n","And then finally, the operating plan will go further. It will base itself on the five-year operating plan. The annual plan will also include for each portfolio the KPIs, the dependencies, and all the activities under that and, of course, because it has a budget, it will have the numbers. So, you’ll be able to see how much we’re spending on each of these areas. Very important work and believe me, there are very few organizations that are functioning with this openness, and with this transparency, and with this commitment to operational excellence of an entire community working together.\n","Finally, I want to share with you a very important new direction. As my boss, Steve Crocker, said in his opening, it just seemed in the last two to three years that ICANN was growing without limit. We would like to start taming that growth. We would like to make sure that ICANN stays within its remit, and to do so, we’re going to set up a baseline operational model. These baseline operations will grow very little every year based on normal year-to-year CPI and other indicators, so we will not be adding to the baseline operations. When a new initiative comes to the fore, we will, as a community, assess it, decide how much it will cost us, decide how it will impact our organization, our priorities, and if we choose to do it, we will spend money on it, and if at the end of that, it leaves some residual work in the baseline, we will up the baseline. But this must be done together. And I want to assure you that by the end of this year, the whole process to add new initiatives will be ready and published so that you can participate, as a community, in deciding how we move forward in adding new work to what we do today.\n","Many of you have shared with me that in the last couple of years, it seemed that staff would be adding new initiatives that we haven’t all discussed in full agreement. This will not happen again because we will do it together in a structured way moving forward.\n","And now, the fifth goal, remember the new fifth goal? A global public interest framework bounded by ICANN’s mission. I wanted to make a small announcement to you. Yesterday, a press release came out of ICANN that we have created a new position in my global leadership team. And this new position which is for a new and focused area called “contractual compliance and consumer safeguards,” will be headed by a new chief officer of contractual compliance. He is here, and many of you should meet him during the week. Allen Grogan, if you could stand up so people can see you. Allen has been our contract -- welcome him -- Allen Grogan has been with us for almost a year and a half, leading the contracting area for registries and has done, frankly, a remarkable job for ICANN. He has many years of experience in the space of Internet and technology law, and we welcome him to the global leadership team.\n","So, what will happen here is important because we are choosing to focus what we’re doing on a global public interest. It’s very important to appreciate where this department is going. Allen will lead two functions. He will first lead the contractual compliance operations. Many of you know Maggie Maguy Serad and her team. They’ve done a solid job operationally. They will now report in to Allen, and if you recall four or five months ago, Akram had announced that the GDD department, the department of global domain names will be adding a function called registrant and consumer safeguards. That group will also move into Allen’s new area. Contract compliance and safeguard will also be considering new ways that ICANN can work cooperatively with others in the Internet community to help safeguard registrants and the global Internet community by improving and enhancing our contract enforcement activities. They will also explore other activities that we may undertake to help protect the health, the lives, the security, and the privacy of Internet users and registrants around the world. All of these activities must be consistent with ICANN’s unlimited mandate, vision, and core values.\n","Now, I want to be very clear about this. We will engage with law enforcement and regulatory agencies, if and when appropriate, to help safeguard registrants in the community, but ICANN is not in the business of law enforcement. We are not a regulatory agency, and we will be careful not to cross that line or overstep our limited authority. So, welcome aboard Allen. I look forward to work with you so that we can enhance this important function and commit ourselves that compliance and consumer safeguards are rooted in the public interest to which we are missioned.\n","Finally, I want to talk about what we’re all talking about - the US Government transition that is undertaking. This transition has to date four tracks. Two tracks, the main tracks are community-led tracks. The first one, as you know, is to work together on how we’re going to transition specific IANA functions at ICANN from the current regime where the US Government has applied some stewardship in the past. The second part is to strengthen ICANN’s governance and accountability. Now, this has been on everybody’s discussion list. We need to improve ICANN’s governance and accountability, and the answer to that is absolutely we must. And if we don’t strive to improve our governance and accountability at all times and especially this time, we will not gain and maintain the confidence of the world that ICANN leadership, ICANN Board, ICANN community is committed to the best possible governance and accountability mechanisms there are. So, whilst we had some discussion for the last few months how to organize this, I think all of us would agree that today, we are completely aligned. We know where we’re going, and we’ll move forward together to start building these accountability measures.\n","Within the second track, we have also agreed to have two parallel efforts. One, to deal with accountability mechanisms that must be reinforced or added before the transition occurs or along with the transition, and this is something Assistant Secretary [Lawrence] Strickling made clear in his speech in Istanbul that he will be looking for community consensus -- community consensus -- on how we improve our accountability with regard specifically to the transition. And then in parallel, another group, because we’re also receiving these requests, needs to look at the broader ICANN accountability and governance improvements that we need to do that may not need to be necessarily taken care of before a transition occurs. So, by creating these two parallel efforts that are intricately tied but on different timelines, we satisfy the needs of the global community and our community to move forward and improve ICANN’s accountability.\n","Now, these two blue tracks at the bottom, in case anybody is worried about these, this is simply what staff needs to do to implement what comes out from the green tracks. So, if the decision on how IANA functions will occur impacts our operations, we need to be prepared for that. So, we are going to be doing pilots. We are going to be doing work so that we are prepared and not surprised how to move forward. But all of this will be done in concert with the green tracks that are community-led. This is simply so that we do everything we can to be ready as the transition becomes a requirement on ICANN staff to change what we do.\n","We are poised for a good harvest. Things are looking good right now. The community is aligned. The transition is moving forward well on ensuring that ICANN delivers services to all of you in the best possible way. And that’s where my time is. That is where my focus is. I want you to know that. I’ve heard you clearly that now more than ever is the time to strengthen ICANN to make sure that we remain strong, united, and confident as the world is watching how we will be post the US transition.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," we have about 2,500 people registered for ICANN51. this is the largest ballroom we’ve ever had at an opening of icANN. there are 12,000 seats here in this room. if you’re here for the first time, could you stand up so we'd get a sense of who’s here?Welcome. Welcome. welcome to all of you, and we hope this meeting will encourage you to stay with us. --------------------------\n","603 \n","Original text: Thank you. Good morning. A number of comments to make about the situation. First, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet visited Caracas last week. There are over 715 political prisoners and military prisoners being held arbitrarily in Venezuela, and we are hoping that the high commissioner’s representatives, who are currently in Venezuela, who stayed there when she left, will visit the country’s most notorious prisons and visit political prisoners. And we hope that her report, which is due out July 5th, will reveal the brutal truths that victims of the regime suffer every day. We hope the report will call, as so many democracies around the world have, for free elections as a central part of the solution to Venezuela’s crisis.\n","A word on the humanitarian situation: Instead of caring for or worrying about the millions of poor, sick, or hungry citizens, the Maduro regime is spending millions of dollars on military purchases. We learned recently of a 38 million dollar purchase of military uniforms. In May, Venezuela signed a 209 million dollar air defense contract with Russia to repair an air defense system, to buy nine Sukhoi fighter jets, and to buy eight transport helicopters. The regime also continues giving foreign aid to Cuba, providing oil without payment in exchange, unless the payment is the repressive intelligence apparatus, manned by about 2,500 Cuban agents that Cuba maintains in Venezuela to help keep the regime in power.\n","Yesterday, a Russian military aircraft arrived in Caracas, which the Russians say was carrying additional technicians to service previously sold arms systems. What we do know for sure is that it carried no humanitarian aid. And right now, the USNS Comforthospital ship is heading into the Caribbean and South America, and will dock at a number of ports to bring medical care to Venezuelan refugees and local residents while Russia is sending its warship the [Admiral] Gorshkov and more military technicians to Venezuela.\n","Inside Venezuela, the Maduro regime continues to undermine democratic institutions, to carry out human rights abuses, and to engage in rampant and extremely widespread corruption. The Maduro regime continues to drive the economy into the ground. Even Russian and Chinese officials have expressed frustration with Maduro’s poor decisions. It’s very clear that Maduro is not capable of solving Venezuela’s many crises.\n","The last remaining democratic institution in Venezuela is the National Assembly, but now, 20 National Assembly deputies have been stripped of their immunity. More than a dozen of them forced into exile; two have been arbitrarily detained. The regime is methodically working to destroy Venezuela’s democratically elected parliament. So we ask the nations of the Lima Group, the International Contact Group, the members of the European Union, and indeed all democracies to stand behind the National Assembly and denounce the regime’s systematic persecution.\n","This is one of the reasons why the notion that Maduro might remain president to preside over free elections and a transition to democracy is laughable. These attacks on the only remaining democratic institution in Venezuela are yet another proof that the Maduro regime cannot be trusted to organize free and fair elections.\n","Interim President Juan Guaido continues to travel throughout the country distributing humanitarian assistance, organizing health clinics, and spreading an important message: that he seeks a peaceful, democratic transition. Maduro’s security forces oppress Venezuelans who demand a better future and they censor communications involving Guaido. But they’ve been unable to suppress the rallies when Interim President Guaido travels throughout the country. Those rallies have been large and impressive, including very recently, for example, cities like Barinas, Hugo Chavez’s birthplace, cities that were once Chavez strongholds. We support Interim President Guaido’s efforts. The barrier to a peaceful resolution remains Maduro’s refusal to step aside.\n","Thank you.\n","Mr. Palladino: Reuters, Lesley.\n","Mr. Abrams: Hi.\n","Question: Hello, Mr. Abrams. I wonder if you can comment on the report today in the Washington Post -- or it was actually yesterday, I think -- regarding the fact that the General Cristopher Figuera was -- is -- has landed in the U.S. What exactly are you planning to do with him, ask him? What are you hoping to get from him in your campaign against Venezuela -- against Maduro?\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, he’s not under detention.\n","Question: No, I know, but --\n","Mr. Abrams: He’s in the U.S. and he’s a free man. I would like to talk to him myself. I assume other U.S. officials would like to, because he quite obviously, as we can see from his position and we can see from the Post interview, has a lot of interesting things to say about the Maduro regime and about life in Venezuela.\n","Mr. Palladino: Let’s go BBC, Barbara. Question: This was obviously a very sophisticated coup plot, which didn’t end up ousting Maduro. Do you think that it is over or do you see it lying low for a while? I mean, he didn’t purge anybody either, not essentially, but it seems difficult to imagine something like this being organized again in the near future.\n","Mr. Abrams: This is June 25th. June 24th is the commemoration every year of the Battle of Carabobo, which was perhaps the greatest victory of Simon Bolivar over royalist forces, beginning of independence for Venezuela. And every year, there’s a big military parade, as you’d expect on Army Day, but not yesterday. Why not? Our conclusion is that Maduro was actually afraid to permit a military parade because he has so little faith in the loyalty of the Venezuelan military to him and his regime. So we can’t predict the future. I can only say that it seems that if you ask Maduro, his fears of another coup are not over.\n","Question: Just a follow-up, if I may, and that’s about the attempts to have a new Oslo process, these talks.\n","Mr. Abrams: Yeah.\n","Question: I know that you’re very skeptical about the talks. You implied that in your comments. But if this is going to drag on for a long time, which is also an option, not just the scenario you suggested, it’s quite cruel what’s happening to the people, whoever’s responsible. Do you see any role for talks or diplomacy involving Maduro and the opposition? Because they seem to, some members of the opposition seem to.\n","Mr. Abrams: Sure. I’m not skeptical about the talks; I’m skeptical about the regime. That is there have been previous rounds of negotiations, and the Maduro regime has used them for delay, just to gain time, and also to try to divide the opposition. We are seeking, as Juan Guaido is, a peaceful resolution, and the negotiated solution would in many ways be the best solution.\n","So we’re not skeptical about the talks or about the Norwegian effort. We’re just skeptical about whether the regime is serious about them. I mean, as an example, if they were serious would they not stop arresting opposition deputies, driving them into embassies and into exile? If what you’re doing is arresting the people on the other side of the table, how serious are you about talks?\n","So we hope that they succeed. I met last week with the negotiating team for President Guaido in an effort to compare notes and be sure that we could answer any questions they had. So we were hopeful that the talks will produce something, but again, there’s no evidence yet that the regime is serious about them.\n","On the humanitarian side, the regime has sold tons of gold, tons of gold. You’ve seen press reports. Where’s the money? Why isn’t it being spent on the people of Venezuela? How is it possible for a country in this economic situation to be giving millions of barrels of free oil to Cuba instead of trying to sell it and give the proceeds to the people of Venezuela? I don’t think there’s any question as to who’s responsible for the humanitarian situation today any more than there was in January or in December. It’s the regime through corruption and incompetence.\n","We’ve, as you know, tried to get humanitarian aid in. The one rule we’ve had is that the aid has to go to people who need it, meaning it can’t be distributed by or given to the regime, because we know very well that the regime will use it for political purposes. So the church, the Red Cross, Caritas, any NGOs that are reliable would be fine ways to distribute aid. The barrier to having more humanitarian aid is the regime’s refusal to accept it and the regime’s waste of resources that could be dedicated to getting these kinds of goods for the people of Venezuela.\n","Mr. Palladino: ABC Spain. David.\n","Question: Thank you. I wanted to ask you, talking about the humanitarian aid: Is it any point of concern, the corruption allegations of the misuse of humanitarian aid in Cucuta by two people associated with the opposition? Is it any point of concern to you? Do you think President Guaido acted as he should have acted in this problem?\n","Mr. Abrams: I think President Guaido did exactly what he should have done, what any government would have done. You immediately call for an investigation. The investigation is going to have to be done by Colombian officials because these events took place in Colombia, not in Venezuela.\n","Mr. Palladino: To CNN, Kylie.\n","Question: Hi, thank you for doing this. One thing that the administration has maintained is that the military option for backing the ouster of Maduro has been on the table for months. Is that still the case today?\n","Mr. Abrams: Yes.\n","Question: Okay. And expanding a little bit off of the ex-spy chief who is here in town, you seem a little bit surprised that he’s here. So can you clarify if there’s been any --\n","Mr. Abrams: He’s not here, if you mean Washington.\n","Question: Sorry. Sorry, in the U.S.\n","Mr. Abrams: At least to my knowledge he’s not here.\n","Question: So he’s just in the U.S. Mr. Abrams: Yeah.\n","Question: And did the U.S. Government support him coming here at all?\n","Mr. Abrams: We did not bring him to the United States. But I’d say we’re happy he’s here. Makes it easier to have more conversations with him, which, as I said, I plan to do and I’m sure others would like to do also.\n","Question: Okay.\n","Mr. Palladino: Sir, in the blue. Outlet, please.\n","Question: Hi. This is Mehmet, I’m from TRT World. The article that appeared on Washington Post that my colleague mentioned, there’s a claim in there which says over 100 million dollars have been requested to flip important figures in the Maduro government, including the chief justice. Has any U.S. taxpayer dollars been used in this way to --\n","Mr. Abrams: No. None, never.\n","Question: Okay.\n","Mr. Palladino: Back row, please. Your outlet?\n","Question: Thank you. Maria Luisa Rossel, Caracol Radio from Colombia. So how hopeful are you that the presence of General Figuera here in the U.S. will help to persuade other generals in Venezuela to support the Interim President Juan Guaido?\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, I’m hopeful in two ways. First, General Figuera left. What happened to him? He’s here in the U.S. As I said, he’s not under any kind of constraints. He can go wherever he wants. He is out from under sanctions. You remember that when he left, we took the sanctions off, when he left the regime. So that’s a sign to other officials as to what their future might be if they do the same thing.\n","Secondly, he has a lot to say. I would assume that the Post interview is not the last he’ll do. And he will be saying things about the regime that may come as news to members of the military or others in the regime, and that may help change their opinions about the regime and about why it does not deserve their support.\n","Mr. Palladino: Let’s go NBC, Abbie.\n","Question: Thank you.\n","Question: Hi, thanks for doing this. I wanted to follow up on the earlier question and ask: What is the latest on U.S. efforts to get humanitarian aid inside of Venezuela? Are there still boxes of aid in Cucuta, in warehouses? What is the current state of affairs on that?\n","Mr. Abrams: Some of the -- it’s a mix. The perishable items that were in Cucuta and elsewhere -- there were some in Curacao, too, for example -- have had to be distributed. And they are distributed to a combination of Venezuelan refugees and local citizens. The nonperishable items can be warehoused, and there are still lots of items in Cucuta. We’ve been able to move some things into Venezuela. Some of the medical kits were moved out of Colombia to other places and then there were some arrangements to get them into Venezuela.\n","It’s hard to do, again, because we won’t countenance turning them over to the regime, because we know how they will be abused. We have a lot of information, for example, about the CLAP program, which is theoretically helping the poorest Venezuelans but we know it’s been a subject of immense amounts of corruption. Treasury’s FinCEN put out a report about three weeks ago about corruption in the CLAP program.\n","So it’s a mix. Some is still in -- where it was staged. Some has been distributed. Some -- I’d say small amounts we’ve been able to get into Venezuela.\n","Question: And one other, if I could.\n","Mr. Palladino: Sure. Question: Given the numbers of people that we see fleeing and the comparisons now to Syria, being one of the larger humanitarian crises we’ve seen in a long time, is the U.S. considering taking in more Venezuelan refugees during this next year?\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, we don’t, in a sense, “take in.” I mean, people come here or they don’t come here. And there will unquestionably be more Venezuelans coming to the United States because there will be more Venezuelans going everywhere. We’ve seen the -- I think it’s the UN estimate, we’re now up to about four million -- others would say higher -- and it’s going to hit -- at a certain point it’ll hit five million. The numbers in the U.S. are small compared to the numbers in, say, Colombia, or Peru. And they grow faster, needless to say, in the countries that are nearer to Venezuela.\n","Question: Would the government support temporary protected status for Venezuelans --\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, the President made a comment about that about a week ago. I’ve said before that that’s under consideration. There’s actually still not been a decision on that. There are -- I don’t want to say there are no deportations of Venezuelans except under circumstances in which we’re talking about people who have been convicted of crimes. But I can’t recall the deportation of a Venezuelan, and that’s partly because it’s almost impossible to get the documents that you need from Venezuela because of the regime, and there are no direct flights between the United States and Venezuela. So again, I don’t want to say deportations have stopped, but the numbers are extremely low if there are any.\n","Mr. Palladino: Last question. BBC, go ahead.\n","Question: Has the President lost interest in this?\n","Mr. Abrams: No. I don’t know where -- well, I mean, nobody was quoted in that article. I don’t know where that comes from. I can tell you that the day the article -- I think I’m right in saying this -- actually, the day the article appeared, the President met with Prime Minister Trudeau and raised with him Venezuela, and they had a good discussion of Venezuela, which is not a sign of uninterest. In the same day that the President was meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau, the Vice President was in Miami to see off the USNS Comfort. So the notion that there is at the highest levels of the government a diminution of interest is just simply false.\n","Question: Can I have a follow-up?\n","Mr. Palladino: All right, last one, let’s go Lesley.\n","Question: Thank you. Just to follow up on that, I mean, the effort to grow the campaign and the allies that side with you seems to have stalled from where we’re sitting on this side. Is there any kind of consideration to try to change your strategy, maybe include the -- Maduro in some kind of unity government, any kind of strategy to make this work?\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, I think the number 54 will grow soon.\n","Question: Is there something we -- you’re going to tell us? Mr. Abrams: No. Governments can announce for themselves when they want to recognize Guaido. It’s not for us to make that announcement. But I think there will be a change in that number.\n","Given the record that Maduro has built for himself of repression, given the stealing of the election in May 2018, it’s hard to see how he is part of the solution or could be part of a transition government. We talk to the members of the Contact Group and the Lima Group. We talk to the Norwegians. We talk, of course, to lots of Venezuelans, including Chavistas, about options for change in Venezuela. And there is no iron formula that the United States has set out that must be met or change will not be possible, but the notion of Maduro being a contributor to a democratic transition is, I think, very hard to figure out.\n","I would urge you to take a look at an interview today in Madrid, published today, with Felipe Gonzalez, who talks about the transition and the need for Maduro not to be part of the transition.\n","Question: Is that the view of all of these people you speak to -- the Lima Group, the Contact Group, the Venezuelans, includingChavistas -- that there’s no role at all for Maduro?\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, there is a very important role for Maduro --\n","Question: Aside from him leaving.\n","Mr. Abrams: -- which is to put his country ahead of his own personal interests. And that is, in fact, an important role, and it is for any leaders of regimes that have built a similar track record. But again, the United States is not trying to persecute Nicolas Maduro. What we’re trying to do is send a message that the contribution that he has to make to Venezuela now, which is an important contribution, is to let the country move forward, to step aside and let the country return to democracy and begin to rebuild its economy.\n","Mr. Palladino: Great. Thank you very much.\n","Mr. Abrams: Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," a number of comments to make about the situation have been made. the u.n. has visited the country's most notorious prisons, and we hope that the high commissioner’s representatives, who are currently in Venezuela, will visit political prisoners and prisoners if they are held arbitrarily in venezuela. --------------------------\n","604 \n","Original text: Mr. President, Deputy Secretary-General, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to address this General Assembly for the first time and to do so as Prime Minister of a country that has always been a proud and pro-active member at the very heart of this United Nations.\n","This United Nations was formed because leaders across the world knew that they could only deliver security for their citizens at home if they could cooperate, as a community of nations, to deliver security across the globe.\n","Some of the threats that we face together today are familiar to those founding leaders: war, political instability, abuses of human rights and poverty.\n","Others are new: global terrorism, climate change, and unprecedented mass movements of people.\n","We gather here today because we know that such challenges do not respect the borders of our individual nations and that only by working together shall we overcome them.\n","As a new Prime Minister to the United Kingdom my pledge to this United Nations is simple: the UK will be a confident, strong and dependable partner internationally – true to the universal values that we share together.\n","We will continue to honor our commitment to spend 0.7% of our Gross National Income on development, building on the achievements we have already made to reduce poverty, deal with instability and increase prosperity the world over. And we will drive forward the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n","We will continue to champion the rights of women and girls, making sure that all girls get the education they deserve, and tackling horrific abuses such as female genital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in conflict.\n","We will continue to be a steadfast, permanent member of the Security Council, meeting our NATO commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defense and making a leading contribution to UN peacekeeping efforts, where we have doubled our commitment, including new deployments to Somalia and South Sudan.\n","We will continue to stand up for the rules based international system and for international law, and I join other leaders in condemning the outrageous bombing of the aid convoy in Syria yesterday.\n","We will continue to play our part in the international effort against climate change. And in a demonstration of our commitment to the agreement reached in Paris, the UK will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris agreement, and complete these before the end of the year.\n","And we will continue to strengthen our existing partnerships, from this United Nations, to the Commonwealth and NATO, seeking to resolve conflict in countries across the world -- from Colombia and Cyprus to Somalia and Yemen.\n","But we must never forget that we stand here, at this United Nations, as servants of the men and women that we represent back at home.\n","And as we do so, we must recognize that for too many of these men and women the increasing pace of globalization has left them feeling left behind.\n","The challenge for those of us in this room is to ensure that our governments and our global institutions, such as this United Nations, remain responsive to the people that we serve. That we are capable of adapting our institutions to the demands of the 21st Century and ensuring that they do not become irrelevant.\n","So when it comes to the big security and human rights challenges of our time, we need this -- our United Nations -- to forge a bold new multilateralism.\n","Because as we have seen even in the past week, no country is untouched by the threat of global terrorism. And when extremists anywhere in the world can transmit their poisonous ideologies directly into the bedrooms of people vulnerable to radicalization, we need not just to work together to prevent conflict and instability in nation states but to act globally to disrupt the networks terrorist groups use to finance their operations and recruit to their ranks.\n","When we see the mass displacement of people, at a scale unprecedented in recent history, we must ensure we are implementing the policies that are fit for the challenges we face today.\n","And when criminal gangs do not respect our national borders, trafficking our fellow citizens into lives of slavery and servitude, we cannot let those borders act as a barrier to bringing such criminals to justice.\n","In each of these areas, it is the convening power of our United Nations that gives us a unique opportunity to respond. But we can only do so if we modernize and adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.\n","As a United Nations we have shown how we can work together to reduce the threat from international terrorism by preventing conflict and instability from developing.\n","For example, through our Permanent Membership of the Security Council, Britain has played a leading role in the fight against Al Shabaab in Somalia. Since 2010, with huge support from across the region, and critically the commitment of Somalis themselves, Al Shabaab has been driven from all the major cities it used to control.\n","It is vital that as an international community we continue to support countries in the region that are contributing thousands of troops, and that we continue to build the capacity of Somali security forces. That is why the UK is now going to increase further our security support and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017 to maintain this vital momentum.\n","Missions like this must remain central to the work of this United Nations, but on their own they are not enough.\n","Because the terrorist threats we face today do not come from one country but exist in a different space. The global networks they exploit require a different kind of global response.\n","These organizations are using our own modern banking networks against us. So we need to look at our regulations, our information sharing and using our technological capabilities to get ahead of them.\n","They are targeting our airlines, exploiting the fact that no one country can keep its citizens safe when they are flying between multiple jurisdictions.\n","That is why this week the United Nations will vote on a UK led resolution on aviation security to ensure that every country implements the standards we need to ensure that no country is the weak link.\n","They are exploiting the internet and social media to spread an ideology that is recruiting people to their cause all over the world. So we need to tackle this ideology head-on.\n","That is why the UK has championed the work that the Secretary General has led to develop a strategy for preventing violent extremism. Now, as an international community, we must work together to adopt and implement the most comprehensive national action plans to tackle both the causes and the symptoms of all extremism.\n","It is not enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism, violent extremism and non-violent extremism; Islamist and neo-Nazi -- hate and fear in all their forms.\n","Just as we need the United Nations to modernize to meet the challenges of terrorism in the 21st Century, so we also need to adapt if we are to fashion a truly global response to the mass movements of people across the world and the implications this brings for security and human rights.\n","The 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol must remain the bedrock of our response, but the context in which they must be applied has dramatically changed.\n","Across the world today, there are 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced. That it is equivalent to the entire population of the United Kingdom.\n","It is an unprecedented figure, one that has almost doubled in a decade. And yet UN appeals are underfunded; host countries are not getting enough support; and refugees are not getting the aid, education and economic opportunities they need.\n","We must do more. And as the second largest bi-lateral provider of assistance, the UK remains fully committed to playing a leading role.\n","In the last 5 years the UK has invested over $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, saving millions of lives every year.\n","The London Syria Conference in February raised $12 billion in pledges, the largest amount ever raised in one day in response to a humanitarian crisis.\n","And that money is being used to combine both urgent humanitarian assistance and vital economic development, benefitting both refugees and the communities and countries hosting them.\n","Clearly we need to continue our efforts to bring an end to the conflict and the appalling slaughter in Syria and to get aid through to those who need it.\n","And while these efforts continue inside Syria, we also agreed new efforts to support refugees and host communities in neighboring countries, including through education and opportunities to work. This is being assisted by loans from international financial institutions and access to European markets. And through our trading relationships and direct engagement with businesses we are mobilizing the private sector to create new jobs in the region for everyone.\n","And while there is more to be done, it is this approach to financing both humanitarian support and economic development that I will be championing when I announce a further UK financial contribution at President Obama’s Refugee Summit later today.\n","But in addition to refugees and displaced people fleeing conflict and persecution, we are also seeing an unprecedented movement of people in search of greater economic opportunities through the same unmanaged channels.\n","This affects all of us, and it is the responsibility of us all to take action. We cannot ignore this challenge, or allow it to continue unmanaged. We need to do better. Better for the countries people leave, for the countries they move through, for the countries they try to get to -- and most of all, better for the migrants and refugees themselves.\n","Despite the huge increase in international efforts, more migrants have died attempting hazardous journeys across borders this year than any other. I believe we have to use the opportunity afforded by this General Assembly for an honest global debate to address this global challenge.\n","In doing so, we should be clear that there is nothing wrong with the desire to migrate for a better life. And also that controlled, legal, safe, economic migration brings benefits to our economies.\n","But countries have to be able to exercise control over their borders. The failure to do so erodes public confidence, fuels international crime, damages economies and reduces the resources for those who genuinely need protection and whose rights under the Refugee Convention should always be fulfilled.\n","I believe there are three fundamental principles that we now need to establish at the heart of a new approach to managing migration that is in the interests of all those involved.\n","First, we must help ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. The current trend of onward movements, where refugees reach a safe country but then press on with their journey, can only benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to grave danger.\n","So we must all do more to support countries where the refugees first arrive, to provide the necessary protection and assistance for refugees safely and swiftly, and to help countries adapt to the huge economic impact that refugees can have -- including on their existing population.\n","As we are seeing in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, when the right assistance is provided, solutions that provide sanctuary and opportunity to refugees, and opportunities for those hosting them, can be found.\n","This is also good for the refugees and the countries they come from -- because the closer they stay to home, the easier it will be for them to return and rebuild after the conflict.\n","Second, we need to improve the ways we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants. I believe we must ensure the existing convention and protocol are properly applied to provide protection to refugees and reduce the incentives for economic migrants to use illegal routes. This in turn will help us target support for those refugees who need it most and retain the support of our populations for doing so.\n","Third, we need a better overall approach to managing economic migration which recognizes that all countries have the right to control their borders -- and that we must all commit to accepting the return of our own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere.\n","By ensuring a managed and controlled international migration response - and at the same time investing to tackle the underlying drivers of displacement and migration at source -- we can reject isolationism and xenophobia, achieving better outcomes for all of our citizens -- and particularly for the most vulnerable.\n","Finally, as we gather here today to bring the founding values of the United Nations to bear on some of the most pressing global problems, the likes of which we haven’t seen before, so we must also face up to the fact that some of the worst human rights abuses that we thought we had confined to the history books have re-emerged in new pernicious forms.\n","The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed by the General Assembly stated that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that no one shall be held in slavery or servitude and that slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.\n","Yet nearly 70 years on, we are presented with a new form of slavery: modern slavery.\n","Organized crime groups, who are largely behind this modern slavery, lure, dupe and force innocent men, women and children into extreme forms of exploitation.\n","Trafficked and sold across borders; victims are forced into living the kind of inhumane existence that is almost too much for our imagination.\n","These criminals have global networks to help them make money out of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions under the constant shadow of violence and forced into sex and labor exploitation.\n","If we are going to succeed in stamping out this abhorrent crime and bring the perpetrators to justice, we need to confront the reality of what we are dealing with.\n","These organized crime groups work across borders and jurisdictions. And they often use the internet and modern technology to recruit, transport, control and exploit their victims, all the while staying ahead of legal systems that are often constrained by traditional geographical boundaries.\n","So we must take action.\n","We must use our international law enforcement networks to track these criminals down, wherever they are in the world, and put them behind bars where they belong.\n","We need to be smarter and even more coordinated than the criminal gangs in our efforts to stop them.\n","In the UK, I am setting up the first ever government taskforce for modern slavery, bringing together every relevant department to coordinate and drive all our efforts in the battle against this cruel exploitation.\n","We are also using our aid budget to create a dedicated fund focused on high risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the UK.\n","And yesterday, I committed the first £5 million from this fund to work in Nigeria to reduce the vulnerability of potential victims and step up the fight against those who seek to profit from this crime.\n","But if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal to eradicate modern slavery, we need to go much further.\n","Security relationships have developed between so many countries for dealing with issues like counter-terrorism, cyber security, drug trafficking and wider intelligence sharing. But we do not have a similar relationship for this fight against modern slavery.\n","So we need our law enforcement agencies to work together, with joint investigation teams working across multiple countries.\n","Victims will only find freedom if we cultivate a radically new, global and coordinated approach to defeat this vile crime.\n","Together we must work tirelessly to preserve the freedoms and values that have defined our United Nations from its inception.\n","Together we must work tirelessly to restore these freedoms and values to the lives of the men, women and children who are exploited for profit and held captive with little or no chance of escape.\n","From the Saint James’ Palace Declaration and the Atlantic Charter forged by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt, to the first meeting of this General Assembly in London in 1946, the United Kingdom has always been an outward-facing, global partner at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and prosperity for all our people.\n","And that is how we will remain. For when the British people voted to leave the EU, they did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world.\n","Faced with challenges like migration, a desire for greater control of their country, and a mounting sense that globalization is leaving working people behind, they demanded a politics that is more in touch with their concerns; and bold action to address them.\n","But that action must be more global, not less. Because the biggest threats to our prosperity and security do not recognize or respect international borders. And if we only focus on what we do at home, the job is barely half done.\n","So this is not the time to turn away from our United Nations. It is the time to turn towards it.\n","Only we, as members of this community of nations, can act to ensure this great institution becomes as relevant for our future as it has been in our past.\n","So let us come together, true to our founding values but responsive to the challenges of today and let us work together to build a safer, more prosperous and more humane world for generations to come. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the u.s. will continue to champion the rights of women and girls, making sure all girls get the education they deserve, and tackling horrific abuses such as female genital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in conflict. --------------------------\n","605 \n","Original text: Secretary of State, Ladies and Gentlemen, Scouts: Good evening.\n","The principles we live by in a democracy are not new. They are not open to being reinterpreted or watered down or even set aside because of new circumstances. As citizens of we do not only want freedom and human rights for every single person in our society, we want that for every person in the world -- upholding the ideal that all people are born equal and deserve equal rights and dignity; and that is the essence of what it is to be a citizen of a democracy. It is how we treat the weakest or the most vulnerable among us that says the most about our commitment to human rights and equality and justice for all people.\n","And when we are most clearly seen to truly stand for those things in the world, that is when we are safest as a nation. That is when we are most respected and admired. That is when our word counts most internationally. And that is how we inspire others to work with us. We don’t redefine ourselves as different people because we face new and daunting problems. We raise a fight within us to face down those challenges, and we remain true to ourselves.\n","Speaking as an American, the fact is there is not a country in the world that we are not connected to as a result of our unique history. We represent a global world. And when we are at our strongest is when we draw on our diversity as a people to find unity based on our common values and our larger identity. We are not strong despite our diversity; we are strong because of it.\n","So it is time to reclaim for ourselves the idea of what strength is in democratic societies. I firmly believe that strength lies in the decency and common sense of regular citizens -- such as the people who turned out in the thousands after the tragedy in Orlando, supported by millions of like-minded people around the world, from every race and religion. Strength lies in identifying how to address the very particular challenge from a small minority of people who choose the path of violent extremism, or who abuse a religion, without stigmatizing [and] isolating millions of people who share in that beautiful religion.\n","There is nothing strong about denigrating anyone on the basis of their religion, nationality, sexual orientation, gender -- or on the basis of any characteristic or difference, real or imagined. When we discriminate, when we imply by our actions that some lives are worth more than others, or when we denigrate the faith, traditions, and cultures of any group of people, we weaken our strength as democratic societies.\n","So, what would it say about us as a country and an international community if we reach the point where we decided we were not prepared to stand up for our principles? The answer to addressing the global refugee crisis surely lies in finding common purpose and drawing strength from each other, like we all feel in this room right now; in staying true to who we are, and showing that we have the fight in us to confront our generation’s test, and emerge stronger for it.\n","That is my hope and I believe I share it with all of you and millions of people beyond this room. So thank you so much for all that you do, for allowing me to be here with you.\n","Thank you for letting me join you this evening. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the principles we live by in a democracy are not new; they aren't open to being reinterpreted or watered down or set aside because of new circumstances. we want that for every person in the world, upholding the ideal that all people are born equal and deserve equal rights and dignity; and that is the essence of what it is to be an citizen of democracy. --------------------------\n","606 \n","Original text: Thank you. Thanks to my partner, Bob [Work], and thanks to all of you in this room. I think if I went around this room, two-thirds, three-quarters of you I know by name and in person. And it’s wonderful to be back with you again, and wonderful to be back with this wonderful institution. The last time I was in this auditorium, I was departing, I thought for the last time, and Marty Dempsey mistook me briefly for Ashton Kutcher. But only very briefly.\n","And that was the last opportunity I had to be with you. But I’m very pleased to be back with you. It’s been a highest honor of my lifetime, and the highest honor that I think an American can have to be a Secretary of Defense.\n","We have been blessed -- Secretary Work indicated that I’ve worked for 11 secretaries of defense, and that’s true -- and I think it’s true that our country has been blessed with the secretaries of defenses we have had. And the ones that I’ve worked for have been very distinguished.\n","And in that connection, I want to extend a thanks to my predecessor, Secretary Chuck Hagel. I knew Chuck Hagel for decades before he became Secretary of Defense. I worked for him as Secretary of Defense, and as distinguished and as dedicated a public servant this country has never had exceeded than Chuck Hagel. So I thank him wherever he is now, I hope he’s relaxing somewhere, for what he did for all of us and for his dedication to this institution.\n","I’m going to be brief, but I want to be very specific about how I see this job and what I’ll be doing and what my commitments and priorities are, and thereby what I’ll be asking you to reflect in your own accomplishment of your own jobs.\n","The first and most important commitment for me always has been and always will be to you. And to that, I mean the greater you. I know this is getting filmed and anybody who has the opportunity in our greater force to see this, I mean all of you -- those who make the greatest fighting force the world has ever known, and the finest and most decent fighting force the world has ever known. And that’s soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. It is civilians. It is contractors, as Bob said, because in our system, that’s the way we do things. That’s the total national team. And our -- my -- first commitment is to you, to your excellence, to your welfare.\n","Bob mentioned the fallen, the families of the fallen, wounded warriors. I mean, I think we have to start there. When I started my career in defense, it was very, very rare that an American servicemember was wounded-in-action or killed-in-action. It was extremely rare. And when it happened, it was a big deal. It led the news on CNN.\n","When I came to the department six years ago, that was a daily event. And when you went out on Saturdays to the hospital, there was a fresh group of freshly wounded every week, every single week. Week after week after week after week. Thank God those days are largely behind us -- we never will know for how long, that is true -- but I just think that we have to start there. We have to keep those people in our hearts every day.\n","And that leads to me to a commitment to what is my largest responsibility in this job, which is to make sure that we never put anyone and their family in that circumstance without the greatest care and reflection about why we’re doing it and what its purpose is and what the benefit is for our nation and for the future.\n","We have an obligation, those of us here in the Pentagon, to the entire force to make sure that they have everything that they need to accomplish their mission. And that means first of all appropriate compensation, because -- and I always say you can’t pay people enough to do what we ask many of our people to do. And -- but this needs to be a profession which is, whose honor is reflected in the way society honors it. And compensation is part of that.\n","Compensation is only part of it because I think a member of our community knows that their entire value and satisfaction in doing what they do is only partly measured by what they’re paid. It’s also measured by whether there are people to the left and right of them who are equally capable, who are numerous enough to help them get their job done, who are well-enough equipped and well-enough trained that it’s safe for them to do what they’re doing, and that they can be successful doing what they’re doing. So there has to be a balance here.\n","But the objective, which is the overall honoring of service, has to be paramount to us and that’s a generational -- an intergenerational responsibility as well. We honor those who came after us or before us. We honor those who are in service today. And we need to look to how we’re going to honor those in the future. More about that in a moment.\n","We are blessed in that our institution is unparalleled in the world and is held in the highest esteem in our society. And that’s something to be grateful for, but also to honor back. And we do that when we respect the dignity and the safety of each and every member of our community as well, and that’s a priority for me also.\n","And then just to repeat, the most sacred responsibility I have as your Secretary of Defense is to make sure that the dedication and commitment that brought each of you into service is reflected in the way I conduct myself and in the care that I and others, rest of the leadership, express in each and every one of you.\n","A second thing that you’ll see me doing in this role -- and this is a very different job from the jobs I’ve had here in the past -- is to be helping the President and our national leadership make the decisions that will keep us safe and protect our country and protect our allies and friends now and in the future.\n","And the President, able as he is -- and the people around him, able as they are -- that’s just one guy. He needs help. He needs our best thinking, our best ideas, our best analysis. The fact that many of you have vast experience around the world, vast experience going back in, through the decades with what it takes to offer protection to our society -- we need to bring that to bear to help him.\n","We’re a large institution. We’re a beacon of quality, if I may say so, in the federal service. And so, we have a lot to offer our national leadership in helping them make decisions. I intend to be very active in doing that. And I will be counting on you to help me, and lift the great expertise of this department and all of its people to the service of the country’s national security decisions.\n","I’ll be, at the same time, making sure that with the Chairman and the Vice, who’s here today, I am making sure that our President has the best military advice -- in addition to what I will aim to make the best civilian advice he could have -- so that he’ll have another channel into the excellence that is represented in this department. Two heads are better than one, and he’ll get both heads.\n","Then, he will be expecting us, and I will be expecting you, to help me implement those decisions with the excellence for which this department is so long and justifiably known. We -- In that connection, I should emphasize that I’ll expect each of you to be conducting yourselves in a way that reflects the trust that the country has in you, and the appropriateness of the role prescribed to you. And I don’t have any doubt that we’ll do that as we always have, but we need to retain our reputation for being the best and the most honorable.\n","It’s a rough world out there. There’s a lot going on. I could start almost anywhere, but I’ll start where the headlines are -- with ISIL and the barbaric acts that you see perpetrated in the Middle East, and the larger Middle East, and emanating there from. The historical throwbacks in Europe we’re witnessing in Ukraine now, the throwback to an era we thought we had left behind, and I think history ultimately will leave behind, but not everybody understands that right now. The unhealed wounds of the past and the absence of a custom security structure in the Asia-Pacific theater, where half of the world’s population and half of its economy resides. Something that can, is going very well, we can’t afford to let begin go poorly. The ongoing campaign and, I believe, very successful campaign in Afghanistan, but it’s not finished, and it needs to be won, I think can be. Many of you -- I’ve given a lot of my own effort to that -- many of you have given much, much more. Enduring problems like weapons of mass destruction, which have been with us for decades and decades, and newer ones in new domains, like cyber, that have been with us for a much shorter time.\n","So, there’s plenty to do, and you all know what. And that’s what our country expects us to do, is to protect them from these dangers.\n","But, I want to say one other thing to you, to, which is I always try to, in my own mind, and in my own heart, and as I talk to people, remind them that miserable as all that is, and miserable as that -- all that seems to be, we have tremendous, bright opportunities in front of us also as a country.\n","We are not only the finest fighting force in the world, but I think we’re the brightest beacon of hope as a country in the world. If you want evidence of that, take a look at who has all the friends. United States has friends and allies in every part of the world. No other country on earth can say that. In fact, our antagonists have none or few. And that’s a reflection of the fact that our values, and our conduct, and our leadership are followed because people like them, and they’re attracted to them, and they want -- not because they have -- to. And if you want to call that exceptionalism, I call that exceptionalism. And it’s not because we say so, it’s because the behavior of others says so. We have an economy and an economic model that has long been a beacon to the rest of the world, and despite our fits and starts, continues to be.\n","So, we have a lot going for us, a lot to be proud of -- starting here, but everywhere -- and we have tremendous opportunities if only we can all come together and grab hold of them. And that brings me to the third thing I wanted to say about, which is coming together and grabbing hold of many opportunities in -- in front of the -- front of us.\n","One which you can’t talk about defense without mentioning is our budget and resource challenge, sequestration, and so forth. And that is unsafe. It’s dangerous. It’s wasteful. It’s unwise. And you’ll see me doing everything I can -- or everything a Secretary of Defense can do -- to try to bring our country together and get us out of the wilderness of sequester. We don’t belong there. That’s not what our people deserve. It’s not what this institution deserves. It’s not what the problems and opportunities that I was describing require and deserve. And we’ve got to get out of that.\n","That said, that’s just part of the future that we need to embrace. If we’re going to convincingly make the case to our people that they need to spend more on their defense -- which I believe they do -- we need to, at the same time, show them that we know we can do better at spending that money. And that we won’t be able to do unless we are open, and unless we are embracing the future.\n","We’re the most wonderful institution and fighting force in the world. That’s what I inherit from those who went before me. That’s what you all inherit from those who went before you. That’s what we owe to the future.\n","And so, my third preoccupation is to the future. And for us to excel in today’s world, in the future, we have to be open. We have to be open to change. We have to be open to what’s going on out there in the world. We have to be open to the wider world of technology, the wider world of culture, the wider world of how people do things. And maybe they have an idea that we haven’t had yet, and that we need to bring inside. So, if we’re going to continue to be the best, we need to be open to the future and open to change. And you’ll see me challenging you all and myself to be open in that way.\n","We’re also one of the oldest institutions in the country and we’re very proud of our traditions. But at the same time, if we’re going to continue to be that, we have to be open, and we have to change.\n","And one last note on that, which is very important to me.\n","We’re going to hand this place off to the next generation. And we need to be asking ourselves, what will make us attractive to them? What will make us compatible with them? What’s the environment within which they can do their very best? And they’re different from us. All generations are different. And all people, when they’ve gotten to our age, start talking about the next generation’s different. It’s actually true.\n","So, these are -- these kids are different. And we need to think about how we make the conditions of service attractive to them, what it takes to make them effective in an organization or on a battlefield. They behave differently, they think differently, they’ve grown up differently. They’re used to a different kind of environment around them, and we have to make ourselves attractive to them.\n","9/11 was a great galvanizing thing for our country. It brought many people into our midst. It motivated many people to want to be part of this enterprise. And that was a terrific thing, but at a horrible price. And no one could wish something similar upon us in the future.\n","But you do have to ask yourself, what is going to make us attractive in the future? And are we thinking that so that we continue to have young people who choose this life and this mission and this commitment who are as good as you are?\n","That’s not something I take for granted. But it’s not something I’m pessimistic about, either. I think we have something compelling about our commitment, our mission, and the excellence that we represent in these generations that are before me, that those to come will find attractive. And they’ll want to follow not in our footsteps, because they aren’t going to want to do that. They’re going to want to do it in their own kind of -- their own way, but in the same general direction that we came.\n","You’ll see me in the best way that I know how trying to speak to them and speak to the country as a whole about us and who we are. And be trying to reflect who you are. And speak to the generation to come and appeal to them and challenge them to fill the shoes of the really excellent people I see in front of me.\n","You are excellent. You mean everything to me. The people of this department are so very wonderful. And my wife, Stephanie, and I are so very devoted to you. That’s why I’m back. It’s that simple. It’s you. It’s the mission. And I look forward once again to being in your ranks and working with you.\n","Thanks so much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," it's been a highest honor of my lifetime, and the highest honour that i think an american can have to be secretary of defense. in that connection, my predecessor, Secretary Chuck Hagel, has been blessed with secretaries of defences we have had. he worked for him for decades before becoming Secretary of Defense. and as distinguished as dedicated public servant this country has never had exceeded than him. --------------------------\n","607 \n","Original text: Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General:\n","Congratulations upon your unanimous election to preside over the 48th General Assembly of the United Nations.\n","Mr. President, we feel strongly that the time has come for all of us -- communities, nations, peoples, families -- to finally lay down the last collective wreath on the tombs of the fallen combatants and on the monuments of our beloved. It is the right way to honor their memories and to answer the needs of the newly-born. We have to lay the foundations for a new Middle East.\n","The peace agreement between us and the Palestinians is not just an accord signed by political leaders. It is an ongoing profound commitment to the next generation -- Arabs and Israelis, Christians, Moslems, Jews, all other faiths. We know it is not enough to declare an end to war. We have to try to eradicate the roots of all hostilities. If we shall only be trying to bring down violence, but ignore misery, we may discover that we have traded one menace for another peril.\n","Territorial disputes may have been the reason for wars among nations Poverty may become again the seed of violence among peoples. While signing the documents on the lawn of the White House, I could almost sense the breeze of a fresh spring and my imagination began to wander to the skies of our land that may have become brighter to the eyes of all people agreeing and opposing. On the lawn you could almost hear the heavy tread of boots leaving the stage after a hundred years of hostility. You could have listened to the gentle tiptoeing of new steps making a debut in the awaiting world for peace. Yet, we couldn't depart from reality. I know that the solution to the Palestinian issue may be the key to a new beginning, but it is no way the answer to the many needs awaiting us upon returning home.\n","The last decade was comprised of great changes. It saw the finale of East-West confrontation. It opened the gradual disappearance of the North-South polarization. The great continent of Asia, the picturesque continent of South America, introduced the dynamics of an economic making of their own. The dramatic event in South Africa is a declaration to the same effect. So, contrary to all assumptions it has been demonstrated that neither geography nor race is a harassment or an advantage to an economic promise.\n","We witnessed the end of some wars only to discover that the warriors did not reach their own promised land. Some colonized people gained their independence, but they hardly enjoyed its fruits. The dangers may have been over but their hopes evaporated. We have learned that the end of a war should be the beginning of a new genesis which will be the end belligerency, and will put an end to the psychological prejudices. No nation, rich or poor, is able nowadays to attain security, unless the region in which they live becomes secure. The scope of the regional security must exceed the range of ballistic missiles which may hit each and all of us. We are striving to achieve a comprehensive peace. No wound must remain unhealed.\n","Geographically speaking, we live side by side with the Jordanian Kingdom; and what is so obvious geographically, must become clear politically. We have agreed already with the Hashemite Kingdom on many complicated issues and there is no doubt that we can complete the story fully, that we can offer the people of both sides of the river full peace, that the Dead Sea can become a spring of new life, that old waters of the Jordan River can be a source of prosperity flowing from side to side. We hope -- as a matter of fact we are determined -- to make peace with Syria. Yet we ask the Syrian leadership, if it has chosen peace, why does it refuse to meet openly? If Syria is aiming at the Egyptian fruits of peace, it must follow the process that led to it. Both of us have to look ahead and realize that the threats of war are no more than an illusion that...one can return to its unbearable past.\n","We shall not give up our negotiations with our Lebanese neighbors. We do not have any territorial claims, nor any political pretensions concerning Lebanon. We pray, together with many Lebanese, that their country will no longer be a backyard for troublemakers. It is for Lebanon to make a choice between the Hezbollah that operates from its territory and then takes orders from another government, or to insist on having one army, one policy, and a real offer of tranquility to its people and security to its neighbors. Lebanon does not need a license to regain its independence, and Lebanon should not postpone its return to her balanced, traditional policy.\n","Mr. President, I am sure that if there is a new order -- I am not sure if there is a new order in the world, but all of us feel that there is a new world awaiting an order. We're encouraged by the new attempt of the United Nations and its Secretary General to answer the social and economic call of the present era. The United Nations was created as a political answer. Today it must face social and economic questions. The Middle East, which has been an important agenda of the United Nations' history, must become prosperous, not only peaceful. To construct a modern Middle East we need wisdom not less than financial support.\n","We have to rid ourselves of the costly follies of the past and adopt the principles of modern economy. Who will and who should pay the cost of oversized armies? Who will and who should bear the price of the price of an arms race which has reached the level of 50 billion dollars annually? Who will and who should pay for the inefficiencies of old systems? Who will and who should compensate for outmoded censorship of mail, of trade, of travel? And who will comply with the state where suspicion intercepts the enterprising spirit of the people. We can and we should turn to the promise of scientific development, of market economy, of comprehensive education. We must base our industry, our agriculture, our services on the height of the current technologies. We have to invest in our schools. Israel, a country of immigration, is blessed with many scientists and engineers. We shall gladly make this wealth -- this human wealth an available contribution.\n","I know that there is a suspicion that when referring to a common market in the Middle East, or announcing a[n] Israeli contribution, it may be perceived as an attempt to win preference or to establish domination. Ladies and gentlemen, may I say sincerely and loudly that we did not give up territorial control to engage ourselves in economic superiority. The age of domination, political or economic, is dead. The time of cooperation is open. As a Jew, may I say that the virtue, the essence of our history since the times of Abraham and the commandments of Moses, have been an uncompromising opposition to any form of occupation, of domination, of discrimination. For us, Israel is not just a territorial homeland, but a permanent moral commitment as well.\n","There are other questions concerning the building of a common market in the Middle East as to how to attain this when governments are so varied and when economies are so different. The differences in government and economies should not prevent us from doing together what can be done together -- combating the desert and offering fertility to an arid land. The FAO declared that the Middle East must double its agricultural production in the twenty five years to come. The population of the region in the same period of time will double itself anyway. The region is cut by many and large deserts. Its water resources are stingy and scarce. Yet, we know that in a similar period of time, in 25 years between 1950 and [19]75, Israel was able to increase its agriculture production twelve-fold -- unprecedented in history. And during the last decade, 95 percent of the growth of our agriculture resulted from research, planning, training, and organizing.\n","High technology permits nations to attain real independence, and to experience genuine freedom, political as well as economic. There is nothing new about the scarcity of water in our midst. Jacob and Esau drank from the same wells even when their path[s] were separated. But then, unlike today, they couldn't desalinate the sea water. They couldn't computerize irrigation. They couldn't enjoy the potential of biotechnology. We are meeting again with an entirely different opportunity. Greening the land can be accompanied by creating many new jobs for all people in the area.\n","The most promising opportunity may be the development of tourism. No other branch of modern industry assures an immediate growth of the Middle East like this one. Our area is blessed by nature and by history -- a history which is still very much alive. The eternity of Jerusalem, the magnificence of the pyramids, the symbols of Luxor, the hanging gardens of Babylon, the pillars of wisdom in Baalbek, the red palaces of Petra, the inimitable charm of Marakesh, the old winds which still blow in Carthage, not ignoring the beaches of Gaza and the breathing of the perfume of the Jericho fruits. We have to open roads to those wonders and keep them safe and hospitable. Tourism depends on tranquility. Tourism enhance[s] tranquility. And it makes friendship into a vested interest.\n","Thirdly, we have to build an infrastructure with modern means so as to dodge the chasms of the past. Modern transportation and revolutionary communications -- crossing the air, covering the grounds, connecting the seas -- will turn geographic proximities into an economic advantage. We should not ask taxpayers of other countries to finance follies of our own. We have to correct them ourselves. We do not have the moral right to ask the financing of unnecessary wars or wasteful systems.\n","If the thumping of hammers will replace the thunder of the guns, many of the nations will be more than willing to extend a helping hand. They will invest in a better future. They will support the replacement of unwarranted confrontation with much-needed economic competition. Markets may serve the needs of the people not less than the flags are signifying their destinies. The time has come to build a Middle East for the people, not just for the rulers.\n","Mr. President, it wasn't simple to open the locked doors to peace. In the name of God, let them not be closed again so that peace will be comprehensive, embracing all issues, all countries, all generations. We suggest that we'll all negotiate together as equals. We offer a common ground made of mutual respect and mutual compromises. Thirteen years ago have passed since we made peace with Egypt. We are grateful to Egypt and its President for expanding understanding, identified and hidden. In a world in which so many insoluble problems reside, the Palestinians and us have finally shown that in fact there are no insoluble problems -- only people who tend to believe that many problems are insoluble.\n","We have negotiated one of the most complicated issues of the last hundred years. We are grateful to the United States for its support and leadership. We are grateful to both President Clinton and Secretary Christopher for their crucial role. We appreciate the Egyptian role and the Norwegian encouragement, the European involvement and serious contribution [for] the Asian support and blessing. May we now have the right to say to other people in conflict: \"Don't give up. Do not surrender to old obsessions and do not take fresh disappointments at face value.\" What we did others can do as well.\n","Mr. President, we are determined to make the agreement with the Palestinians into a permanent success. Israel would consider an economic success of the Palestinians as though it were its own; and I believe that a newly-achieved security will serve the aspirations of the Israelis and the necessities of the Palestinians. Gaza, after 7,000 years of suffering, can emancipate itself from want. Jericho, without her fallen walls, can see her gardens blossom again.\n","As the 20th century comes to a close, we have learned from the United States and Russia that there are no military answers to the new military dangers -- only political solutions. Successful economies are no longer a monopoly of the rich and the mighty. They represent an open invitation to every nation ready to adopt the combination of science and open-mindedness. We see at the end of this century that politics can achieve more by goodwill than by power, and that the young generation watching their televisions, compare their lot with the fortunes or misfortunes of others. They see freedom, they watch peace, they view prosperity all in real time. They know that they can attain more if they will work harder.\n","If we want to represent their hopes, we have to combine wise policies and regional security and market economies. Historically we were born equal and equally we can give birth to a new age.\n","Behold days are coming, says the Lord, when the ploughman shall overtake the reaper and the trader of grapes, him who sows the seeds and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt.1\n","So said the prophet.\n","Thank you, Mr. President. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the peace agreement between us and the palestinians is not just an accord signed by political leaders. it is an ongoing profound commitment to the next generation -- arabs and Israelis, Christians, Moslems, Jews, all other faiths -- to declare an end to war. we have to try to eradicate the roots of all hostilities. if we shall only be trying to bring down violence, but ignore misery. --------------------------\n","608 \n","Original text: Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, Senator Mitchell, Speaker Wright, Senator Dole, Congressman Michel, and fellow citizens, neighbors, and friends:\n","There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history. President Reagan, on behalf of our Nation, I thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for America.\n","I have just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington 200 years ago, and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed his. It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today, not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration, but because Washington remains the Father of our Country. And he would, I think, be gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity these 200 years since our government began.\n","We meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended.\n","And my first act as President is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads:\n","Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love. Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your work, willing to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: \"Use power to help people.\" For we are given power not to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us to remember it, Lord. Amen.\n","I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree. A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on. There is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken. There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.\n","Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom. Men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity. The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows.\n","We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.\n","For the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all history, man does not have to invent a system by which to live. We don't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We don't have to wrest justice from the kings. We only have to summon it from within ourselves. We must act on what we know. I take as my guide the hope of a saint: In crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; in all things, generosity.\n","America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil, a place we cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and that our strength is a force for good. But have we changed as a nation even in our time? Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?\n","My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not the measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it. What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better, and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?\n","No President, no government, can teach us to remember what is best in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he must.\n","America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world. My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and roaming. There are the children who have nothing, no love, no normalcy. There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction -- drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love. They need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we bless them for choosing life.\n","The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone could end these problems. But we have learned that is not so. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need. We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety. And then we will do the wisest thing of all: We will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows -- the goodness and the courage of the American people.\n","I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. We must bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young. For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation, but so is stewardship. And the generation born after the Second World War has come of age.\n","I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and I will ask every member of my government to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they are not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.\n","We need a new engagement, too, between the Executive and the Congress. The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate. We must bring the Federal budget into balance. And we must ensure that America stands before the world united, strong, at peace, and fiscally sound. But, of course, things may be difficult. We need compromise; we have had dissension. We need harmony; we have had a chorus of discordant voices.\n","For Congress, too, has changed in our time. There has grown a certain divisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other's ideas are challenged, but each other's motives. And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other. It has been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still. But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago; and surely the statute of limitations has been reached. This is a fact: The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory. A new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship must be made new again.\n","To my friends -- and yes, I do mean friends -- in the loyal opposition -- and yes, I mean loyal: I put out my hand. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Speaker. I am putting out my hand to you Mr. Majority Leader. For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand. We can't turn back clocks, and I don't want to. But when our fathers were young, Mr. Speaker, our differences ended at the water's edge. And we don't wish to turn back time, but when our mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader, the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live. Let us negotiate soon and hard. But in the end, let us produce. The American people await action. They didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. \"In crucial things, unity\"--and this, my friends, is crucial.\n","To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace. The \"offered hand\" is a reluctant fist; but once made, strong, and can be used with great effect. There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.\n","Great nations like great men must keep their word. When America says something, America means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps. We will always try to speak clearly, for candor is a compliment, but subtlety, too, is good and has its place. While keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress. One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience. But hope is good, and so are strength and vigilance.\n","Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled. But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by, and the women who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns. I don't mean this to be sentimental. I mean that on days like this, we remember that we are all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that bind.\n","Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land. And to them I say, thank you for watching democracy's big day. For democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze. And to all I say: No matter what your circumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great nation.\n","A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on men's souls. In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, an easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.\n","There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance. The most obvious now is drugs. And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country. And there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop.\n","And so, there is much to do; and tomorrow the work begins. I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.\n","Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets calling, and sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds. And so today a chapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity -- shared, and written, together.\n","Thank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," president obama says he has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in history. it is right that the memory of Washington be with us today, not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration, but because Washington remains the Father of our Country - and we meet on democracy's front porch. i ask you to bow your heads:Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love. --------------------------\n","609 \n","Original text: Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow citizens:\n","As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.\n","Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.\n","Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our union is confident and strong. Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror -- or a lot of gray -- and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their union?\n","Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren.\n","First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past four years, we've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history. And in the last year alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs.\n","When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and the nation is grateful. Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world.\n","America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely or not at all.\n","To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from our high schools so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We will help additional -- an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job-training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And we will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education by increasing the size of Pell Grants.\n","To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities. So we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job creators from junk lawsuits.\n","Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims. And I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.\n","To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over their health decisions.\n","I -- I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health-care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance; a community health center in every poor county; improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs; association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health-care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need.\n","To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy.\n","My Clear Skies legislation will cut power-plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled cars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy.\n","All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand, and fair to all.\n","America's immigration system is also outdated -- unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.\n","One of America's most important institutions -- a symbol of the trust between generations -- is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security. Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement. And for them, the system is sound and fiscally strong.\n","I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you. For you, the Social Security system will not change in any way.\n","For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era. In those days, people did not live as long, benefits were much lower than they are today, and a half century ago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.\n","Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers. And over the next few decades, that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever- higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.\n","So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion dollars to keep the system afloat. And by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion dollars. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other government programs.\n","I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates aren't so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress.\n","You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all. Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated.\n","All these ideas are on the table.\n","I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics.\n","I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer.\n","We must, however, be guided by some basic principles:\n","- We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day.\n","- We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes.\n","- We must ensure that lower-income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement.\n","- We must guarantee that there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement.\n","- And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future.\n","As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts.\n","Here is how the idea works: Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.\n","Here is why the personal accounts are a better deal: Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver. And your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and -- or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away.\n","The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts: We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement.\n","We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts. Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds.\n","It's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young Americans.\n","Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. Government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them.\n","Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage.\n","Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities. And I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others.\n","We should all be able to agree -- We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.\n","Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well-qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so.\n","The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.\n","Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy or gangs or jail.\n","Tonight I propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports. And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush.\n","Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases: African-American men and women.\n","Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit. So we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.\n","Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy. And chief among them is freedom from fear. In the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we've taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half million first responders. Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.\n","Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The Al Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction, but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all. And we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won.\n","Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror. And I thank the Congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have needed. During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory.\n","Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground. The United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections. And NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers.\n","We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists.\n","In the next four years, my Administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time. In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom.\n","Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the \"evil principle\" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\n","The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else.\n","That is one -- That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures.\n","And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the coming years, we will add to that story. The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure.\n","Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for 350 million dollars to support Palestinian political, economic and security reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace is within reach, and America will help them achieve that goal.\n","To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.\n","To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still allows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region.You have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act. And we expect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom.\n","Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you.\n","Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq so we do not have to face them here at home.\n","The victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren. We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, \"Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me, the insurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing. So I got my husband, and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together.\"\n","Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all.\n","One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, \"We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most of all to the soldiers.\" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country. And we are honored that she is with us tonight.\n","The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attack it. Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.\n","We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, \"Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible.\" That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it also is the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq.\n","The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country. At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces -- forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure.\n","As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country, and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty. Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, \"Tell America not to abandon us.\" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come.\n","We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned.\n","Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment. And they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud.\n","The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they are making our nation more secure.\n","Some of our service men and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful nation will do everything we can to help them recover.\n","And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our freedom and whose memory this nation will honor forever.\n","One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. She wrote, \"When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.'\" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.\n","In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us.\n","The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We're all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedom brings.\n","As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, \"Each age is a dream that is dying or one that is coming to birth.\"\n","And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born.\n","The abolition of slavery was only a dream -- until it was fulfilled.\n","The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream -- until it was achieved.\n","The fall of imperial communism was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished.\n","Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. The road of providence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom.\n","Thank you. And may God bless America. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," president obama: we must be good stewards of this economy and renew great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. he says the nation's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government, a budget that holds discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half. the u.s. has added 2.3 million new jobs in the last year alone --------------------------\n","610 \n","Original text: Thank you.

I also want to salute especially Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who will step down in just over 3 months. But let me say, Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar has served with great distinction during a period of unprecedented change and turmoil. For almost 10 years we've enjoyed the leadership of this man of peace, a man that I, along with many of you, feel proud to call friend. So today, let us congratulate our friend and praise his spectacular service to the United Nations and to the people of the world. Mr. Secretary-General.\n","Let me also welcome new members to this chamber: two delegations representing Korea, particularly our democratic friends, the Republic of Korea; the Republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; and new missions from the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.\n","Twenty years ago, when I was the Permanent Representative here for the United States, there were 132 U.N. members. Just 1 week ago, 159 nations enjoyed membership in the United Nations. Today, the number stands at 166. The presence of these new members alone provides reasons for us to celebrate.\n","My speech today will not sound like any you've heard from a President of the United States. I'm not going to dwell on the superpower competition that defined international politics for half a century. Instead, I will discuss the challenges of building peace and prosperity in a world leavened by the Cold War's end, the resumption of history.\n","Communism held history captive for years. It suspended ancient disputes, and it suppressed ethnic rivalries, nationalist aspirations, and old prejudices. As it has dissolved, suspended hatreds have sprung to life. People who for years have been denied their pasts have begun searching for their own identities, often through peaceful and constructive means, occasionally through factionalism and bloodshed.\n","This revival of history ushers in a new era, teeming with opportunities and perils. And let's begin by discussing the opportunities.\n","First, history's renewal enables people to pursue their natural instincts for enterprise. Communism froze that progress until its failures became too much for even its defenders to bear. And now citizens throughout the world have chosen enterprise over envy, personal responsibility over the enticements of the state, prosperity over the poverty of central planning.\n","The U.N. Charter encourages this adventure by pledging \"to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples.\" And I can think of no better way to fulfill this mission than to promote the free flow of goods and ideas. Frankly, ideas and goods will travel around the globe with or without our help. The information revolution has destroyed the weapons of enforced isolation and ignorance. In many parts of the world technology has overwhelmed tyranny, proving that the age of information can become the age of liberation if we limit state power wisely and free our people to make the best use of new ideas, inventions, and insights.\n","By the same token, the world has learned that free markets provide levels of prosperity, growth, and happiness that centrally planned economies can never offer. Even the most charitable estimates indicate that in recent years the free world's economies have grown at twice the rate of the former Communist world.\n","Growth does more than fill shelves. It permits every person to gain, not at the expense of others but to the benefit of others. Prosperity encourages people to live as neighbors, not as predators. Economic growth can aid international relations in exactly the same way. Many nations represented here are parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Uruguay round, the latest in the postwar series of trade negotiations, offers hope to developing nations, many of which have been cruelly deceived by the false promises of totalitarianism.\n","Here in this chamber we hear about North-South problems. But free and open trade, including unfettered access to markets and credit, offer developing countries means of self-sufficiency and economic dignity. If the Uruguay round should fail, a new wave of protectionism could destroy our hopes for a better future. History shows all too clearly that protectionism can destroy wealth within countries and poison relations between them. And therefore, I call upon all members of GATT to redouble their efforts to reach a successful conclusion for the Uruguay round. I pledge that the United States will do its part.\n","I cannot stress this enough: Economic progress will play a vital role in the new world. It supplies the soil in which democracy grows best. People everywhere seek government of and by the people. And they want to enjoy their inalienable rights to freedom and property and person.\n","Challenges to democracy have failed. Just last month coup plotters in the Soviet Union tried to derail the forces of liberty and reform, but Soviet citizens refused to follow. Most of the nations in this chamber stood with the forces of reform, led by Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, and against the coup plotters.\n","The challenge facing the Soviet peoples now -- that of building political systems based upon individual liberty, minority rights, democracy, and free markets -- mirrors every nation's responsibility for encouraging peaceful, democratic reform. But it also testifies to the extraordinary power of the democratic ideal.\n","As democracy flourishes, so does the opportunity for a third historical breakthrough: international cooperation. A year ago, the Soviet Union joined the United States and a host of other nations in defending a tiny country against aggression and opposing Saddam Hussein. For the very first time on a matter of major importance, superpower competition was replaced with international cooperation. The United Nations, in one of its finest moments, constructed a measured, principled, deliberate, and courageous response to Saddam Hussein. It stood up to an outlaw who invaded Kuwait, who threatened many states within the region, who sought to set a menacing precedent for the post-cold war world. The coalition effort established a model for the collective settlement of disputes. Members set the goal, the liberation of Kuwait, and devised a courageous, unified means of achieving that goal.\n","And now, for the first time, we have a real chance to fulfill the U.N. Charter's ambition of working \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and nations large and small to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\" Those are the words from the charter. We will not revive these ideals if we fail to acknowledge the challenge that the renewal of history presents.\n","In Europe and Asia, nationalist passions have flared anew, challenging borders, straining the fabric of international society. At the same time, around the world, many age-old conflicts still fester. You see signs of this tumult right here. The United Nations has mounted more peacekeeping missions in the last 36 months than during its first 43 years. And although we now seem mercifully liberated from the fear of nuclear holocaust, these smaller, virulent conflicts should trouble us all. We must face this challenge squarely: first, by pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes now in progress; second and more importantly, by trying to prevent others from erupting.\n","No one here can promise that today's borders will remain fixed for all time. But we must strive to ensure the peaceful, negotiated settlement of border disputes. We also must promote the cause of international harmony by addressing old feuds. We should take seriously the charter's pledge \"to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.\"\n","UNGA Resolution 3379, the so-called \"Zionism is racism\" resolution, mocks this pledge and the principles upon which the United Nations was founded. And I call now for its repeal. Zionism is not a policy; it is the idea that led to the creation of a home for the Jewish people, to the State of Israel. And to equate Zionism with the intolerable sin of racism is to twist history and forget the terrible plight of Jews in World War II and, indeed, throughout history. To equate Zionism with racism is to reject Israel itself, a member of good standing of the United Nations.\n","This body cannot claim to seek peace and at the same time challenge Israel's right to exist. By repealing this resolution unconditionally, the United Nations will enhance its credibility and serve the cause of peace.\n","As we work to meet the challenge posed by the resumption of history, we also must defend the charter's emphasis on inalienable human rights. Government has failed if citizens cannot speak their minds, if they can't form political parties freely and elect governments without coercion, if they can't practice their religion freely, if they can't raise their families in peace, if they can't enjoy a just return from their labor, if they can't live fruitful lives and, at the end of their days, look upon their achievements and their society's progress with pride.\n","Politicians who talk about \"democracy\" and \"freedom\" but provide neither eventually will feel the sting of public disapproval and the power of people's yearning to live free.\n","Some nations still deny their basic rights to the people. And too many voices cry out for freedom. For example, the people of Cuba suffer oppression at the hands of a dictator who hasn't gotten the word, the lone hold-out in an otherwise democratic hemisphere, a man who hasn't adapted to a world that has no use for totalitarian tyranny. Elsewhere, despots ignore the heartening fact that the rest of the world has embarked upon a new age of liberty.\n","The renewal of history also imposes an obligation to remain vigilant about new threats and old. We must expand our efforts to control nuclear proliferation. We must work to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. It is for this reason that I put forward my Middle East arms initiative, a comprehensive approach to stop and, where possible, reverse the accumulation of arms in that part of the world most prone to violence.\n","We must remember that self-interest will tug nations in different directions and that struggles over perceived interests will flare sometimes into violence. We can never say with confidence where the next conflict may arise. And we cannot promise eternal peace, not while demagogues peddle false promises to people hungry with hope, not while terrorists use our citizens as pawns and drug dealers destroy our peoples. We, as a result, we must band together to overwhelm affronts to basic human dignity.\n","It is no longer acceptable to shrug and say that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Let's put the law above the crude and cowardly practice of hostage-holding.\n","In a world defined by change, we must be as firm in principle as we are flexible in our response to changing international conditions. That's especially true today of Iraq. Six months after the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 687 and 688, Saddam continues to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction and subject the Iraqi people to brutal repression. Saddam's contempt for U.N. resolutions was first demonstrated back in August of 1990. And it continues even as I am speaking. His government refuses to permit unconditional helicopter inspections and right now is refusing to allow U.N. inspectors to leave inspected premises with documents relating to an Iraqi nuclear weapons program.\n","And it is the United States view that we must keep the United Nations sanctions in place as long as he remains in power. And this also shows that we cannot compromise for a moment in seeing that Iraq destroys all of its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. And we will not compromise.\n","This is not to say, and let me be clear on this one, that we should punish the Iraqi people. Let me repeat, our argument has never been with the people of Iraq. It was and is with a brutal dictator whose arrogance dishonors the Iraqi people. Security Council Resolution 706 created a responsible mechanism for sending humanitarian relief to innocent Iraqi citizens. We must put that mechanism to work.\n","We must not abandon our principled stand against Saddam's aggression. This cooperative effort has liberated Kuwait, and now it can lead to a just government in Iraq. And when it does, when it does, the Iraqi people can look forward to better lives, free at home, free to engage in a world beyond their borders.\n","The resumption of history also permits the United Nations to resume the important business of promoting the values that I've discussed today. This body can serve as a vehicle through which willing parties can settle old disputes. In the months to come, I look forward to working with Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar and his successor as we pursue peace in such diverse and troubled lands as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cyprus, El Salvador, and the Western Sahara.\n","The United Nations can encourage free-market development through its international lending and aid institutions. However, the United Nations should not dictate the particular forms of government that nations should adopt. But it can and should encourage the values upon which this organization was founded. Together, we should insist that nations seeking our acceptance meet standards of human decency.\n","Where institutions of freedom have lain dormant, the United Nations can offer them new life. These institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order, an order in which no nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty, an order characterized by the rule of law rather than the resort to force, the cooperative settlement of disputes rather than anarchy and bloodshed, and an unstinting belief in human rights.\n","Finally, you may wonder about America's role in the new world that I have described. Let me assure you, the United States has no intention of striving for a Pax Americana. However, we will remain engaged. We will not retreat and pull back into isolationism. We will offer friendship and leadership. And in short, we seek a Pax Universalis [Universal Peace] built upon shared responsibilities and aspirations.\n","To all assembled, we have an opportunity to spare our sons and daughters the sins and errors of the past. We can build a future more satisfying than any our world has ever known. The future lies undefined before us, full of promise, littered with peril. We can choose the kind of world we want: one blistered by the fires of war and subjected to the whims of coercion and chance, or one made more peaceful by reflection and choice. Take this challenge seriously. Inspire future generations to praise and venerate you, to say, \"On the ruins of conflict, these brave men and women built an era of peace and understanding. They inaugurated a new world order, an order worth preserving for the ages.\"\n","Good luck to each and every one of you. And thank you very, very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," secretary-general has served with great distinction during a period of unprecedented change and turmoil. for almost 10 years we've enjoyed the leadership of this man of peace, an man that I feel proud to call friend. today, let us congratulate our friend and praise his spectacular service to the United Nations and the people of the world. --------------------------\n","612 \n","Original text: Respected citizens of Russia, dear friends:\n","I have just taken the oath of the President of the Russian Federation.

We must make full use of this unique opportunity to turn Russia into one of the world’s best countries; best in providing its people with comfort, confidence and security in their lives. This is our strategy and this is the goal that will guide us in the years ahead.\n","I am fully aware of just how much still needs to be done to make our state truly just and caring towards its citizens and provide the highest possible living standards so that more and more people can swell the ranks of the middle class and gain access to good education and healthcare services.\n","We are committed to innovation in all areas of life, to developing cutting-edge production, modernizing our industry and agriculture, creating big incentives for private investment and generally making every effort to help Russia firmly establish itself as a leader in technological and intellectual development.\n","I place particular importance on the fundamental role of the law, which is the cornerstone of our state and our civil society. We must ensure true respect for the law and overcome the legal nihilism that is such a serious hindrance to modern development.\n","A mature and effective legal system is an essential condition for economic and social development, supporting entrepreneurship and fighting corruption. But it is no less important for increasing Russia’s influence in the international community, making our country more open to the world and facilitating dialogue as equals with other peoples.\n","Finally, true supremacy of the law is only possible if people feel safe in their lives. I will do everything I can to ensure that the safety of our citizens is not just enshrined in the law but is genuinely guaranteed by the state.\n","These tasks I have named call for day-to-day cooperation with all the responsible political forces in our society, with all the institutions of civil society and with the parties and the country’s regions.\n","I hope that cooperation between our country’s different religious faiths and social and ethnic groups will continue to strengthen peace and harmony in our common home.

But I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances never before experienced by Americans. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.\n","Therefore, I feel it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen. Not an inaugural address, not a fireside chat, not a campaign speech -- just a little straight talk among friends. And I intend it to be the first of many.\n","I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers. And I hope that such prayers will also be the first of many. If you have not chosen me by secret ballot, neither have I gained office by any secret promises. I have not campaigned either for the Presidency or the Vice Presidency. I have not subscribed to any partisan platform. I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as I begin this very difficult job.\n","I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it. Those who nominated and confirmed me as Vice President were my friends and are my friends. They were of both parties, elected by all the people and acting under the Constitution in their name. It is only fitting then that I should pledge to them and to you that I will be the President of all the people.\n","Thomas Jefferson said the people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty. And down the years, Abraham Lincoln renewed this American article of faith asking, \"Is there any better way or equal hope in the world?\"\n","I intend, on Monday next, to request of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate the privilege of appearing before the Congress to share with my former colleagues and with you, the American people, my views on the priority business of the Nation and to solicit your views and their views. And may I say to the Speaker and the others, if I could meet with you right after these remarks, I would appreciate it.\n","Even though this is late in an election year, there is no way we can go forward except together and no way anybody can win except by serving the people's urgent needs. We cannot stand still or slip backwards. We must go forward now together.\n","To the peoples and the governments of all friendly nations, and I hope that could encompass the whole world, I pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace. America will remain strong and united, but its strength will remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire family of man, as well as to our own precious freedom. I believe that truth is the glue that holds government together, not only our Government but civilization itself. That bond, though stained, is unbroken at home and abroad.\n","In all my public and private acts as your President, I expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end.\n","My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.\n","Our Constitution works. Our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here, the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy. As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.\n","In the beginning, I asked you to pray for me. Before closing, I ask again your prayers, for Richard Nixon and for his family. May our former President, who brought peace to millions, find it for himself. May God bless and comfort his wonderful wife and daughters, whose love and loyalty will forever be a shining legacy to all who bear the lonely burdens of the White House. I can only guess at those burdens, although I have witnessed at close hand the tragedies that befell three Presidents and the lesser trials of others.\n","With all the strength and all the good sense I have gained from life, with all the confidence of my family, my friends, and my dedicated staff impart to me, and with the good will of countless Americans I have encountered in recent visits to 40 States, I now solemnly reaffirm my promise I made to you last December 6: To uphold the Constitution; to do what is right as God gives me to see the right; and to do the very best I can for America.\n","God helping me, I will not let you down.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john avlon: the oath that I have taken is the same that that was taken by George Washington. he says it's an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts. it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen. --------------------------\n","614 \n","Original text: John and Caroline, Ed [Schlossberg] and Maurice [Tempelsman], members of the family, Mrs. Clinton, members of the clergy, and friends:\n","Last summer, when we were on the upper deck on the boat at the Vineyard, waiting for President and Mrs. Clinton to arrive, Jackie turned to me and said:\n","\"Teddy, you go down and greet the President.\"\n","But I said: \"Maurice is already there.\"\n","And Jackie answered with a smile: \"Teddy, you do it. Maurice isn’t running for re-election.\"\n","She was always there for our family in her special way. She was a blessing to us and to the nation -- and a lesson to the world on how to do things right, how to be a mother, how to appreciate history, how to be courageous. No one else looked like her, spoke like her, wrote like her, or was so original in the way she did things. No one we knew ever had a better sense of self.\n","Eight months before she married Jack, they went together to President Eisenhower’s Inaugural Ball. Jackie said later that that’s where they decided they liked inaugurations.\n","No one ever gave more meaning to the title of \"First Lady.\" The nation’s capital city looks as it does because of her. She saved Lafayette Square and Pennsylvania Avenue. The National Cultural Center was her cause before it was The Kennedy Center. Jackie brought the greatest artists to the White House, and brought the arts to the center of national attention. Today, in large part because of her inspiration and vision, the arts are an abiding part of national policy.\n","President Kennedy took such delight in her brilliance and her spirit. At a White House dinner, he once leaned over and told the wife of the French Ambassador, “Jackie speaks fluent French. But I only understand one out of every five words she says -- and that word is \"DeGaulle.”\n","And then, during those four endless days in 1963, she held us together as a family and a country. In large part because of her, we could grieve and then go on. She lifted us up, and in the doubt and darkness, she gave her fellow citizens back their pride as Americans. She was then 34 years old.\n","Afterward, as the eternal flame she lit flickered in the autumn of Arlington Cemetery, Jack[ie] went on to do what she most wanted -- to raise Caroline and John, and warm her family’s life and that of all the Kennedys.\n","Robert Kennedy sustained her, and she helped make it possible for Bobby to continue. She kept Jack[’s] memory alive and he carried Jack’s mission on.\n","Her two children turned out to be extraordinary: honest, unspoiled, and with a character equal to hers. And she did it in the most trying circumstances. They are her two miracles.\n","Her love for Caroline and John was deep and unqualified. She reveled in their accomplishments; she hurt with their sorrows; she felt sheer joy and delight in spending time with them. At the mere mention of one of their names, Jackie’s eyes would shine brighter and her smile would grow bigger. She once said that if you “bungle raising your children nothing else much matters in life.” She didn’t bungle. Once again, she showed how to do the most important thing of all, and do it right.\n","When she went to work, Jackie became a respected professional in the world of publishing. And because of her, remarkable books came to life. And she searched out new authors and ideas. She was interested in everything. Her love of history became a devotion to historic preservation. You knew, when Jackie joined the cause to save a building in Manhattan, the bulldozers might as well turn around and go home.\n","She had a wonderful sense of humor -- a way of focusing on someone with total attention -- and a little girl delight in who they were and what they were saying. It was a gift of herself that she gave to others. And in spite of all of her heartache and loss, she never faltered.\n","I often think of what she said about Jack in December after he died: \"They made him a legend, when he would have preferred to be a man.\" Jackie would have preferred to be just herself, but the world insisted that she be a legend too. She never wanted public notice -- in part I think, because it brought back painful memories of unbearable sorrow endured in the glare of a million lights. In all the years since then, her genuineness and depth of character continued to shine through the privacy, and reach people everywhere.\n","Jackie was too young to be a widow in 1963, and too young to die now. Her grandchildren were bringing new joy to her life, a joy that illuminated her face whenever you saw them together. Whether it was taking Rose and Tatiana for an ice cream cone, or taking a walk in Central Park with little Jack as she did last Sunday, she relished being \"Grandjackie\" and showering her grandchildren with love.\n","At the end, she worried more about us than herself. She let her family and friends know she was thinking of them. How cherished were those wonderful notes in her distinctive hand on her powder blue stationary.\n","In truth, she did everything she could -- and more -- for each of us. She made a rare and noble contribution to the American spirit. But for us, most of all she was a magnificent wife, a mother, a grandmother, a sister, aunt, and friend.\n","She graced our history. And for those of us who knew and loved her -- she graced our lives. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the nation's capital city looks as it does because of her. the national cultural center was her cause before it was The Kennedy Center. she brought the arts to the center of national attention. --------------------------\n","615 \n","Original text: Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker,\n","And I rise to oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and in so doing I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. I will not.\n","And the government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man -- not now, not ever.\n","The Leader of the Opposition says that people who hold sexist views and who are misogynists are not appropriate for high office. Well I hope the Leader of the Opposition has got a piece of paper and he is writing out his resignation. Because if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives -- he needs a mirror. That's what he needs.\n","Then, of course, I was offended too by the sexism, by the misogyny, of the Leader of the Opposition catcalling across this table at me as I sit here as Prime Minister, \"if the Prime Minister wants to, politically speaking, make an honest woman of herself\" -- something that would never have been said to any man sitting in this chair. I was offended when the Leader of the Opposition went outside in the front of the parliament and stood next to a sign that said \"Ditch the Witch.\" I was offended when the Leader of the Opposition stood next to a sign that described me as a man's [Bob Brown's] bitch. I was offended by those things. Misogyny, sexism -- every day from this Leader of the Opposition. Every day, in every way, across the time the Leader of the Opposition has sat in that chair and I have sat in this chair, that is all we have heard from him.\n","Now the Leader of the Opposition wants to be taken seriously. Apparently he has woken up, after this track record and all of these statements, and has gone, \"Oh dear, there is this thing called sexism; oh my lord, there is this thing called misogyny. Who is one of them? The Speaker must be because that suits my political purpose.\" He does not turn a hair about any of his past statements; does not walk into this parliament and apologize to the women of Australia; does not walk into this parliament and apologize to me for the things that have come out of his mouth -- but he now seeks to use this as a battering ram against someone else. This kind of hypocrisy should not be tolerated, which is why this motion from the Leader of the Opposition should not be taken seriously. Second, the Leader of the Opposition is always wonderful at walking into this parliament and giving me and others a lecture about what they should take responsibility for. He is always wonderful about everything that I should take responsibility for, now apparently including the text messages of the member for Fisher. He is always keen to say others should assume responsibility, particularly me. Can anybody remind me whether the Leader of the Opposition has taken any responsibility for the conduct of the Sydney Young Liberals and the attendance at their event of members of his frontbench? Has he taken any responsibility for the conduct of members of his political party and members of his frontbench, who apparently when the most vile things were being said about my family raised no voice of objection. [Government members interjecting] The Deputy Speaker: Order! Ministers on the front bench are not assisting. PM GILLARD: No one walked out of the room, no one walked up to Mr.. Jones and said that this was not acceptable. Instead, it was all viewed as good fun -- until it was run in a Sunday newspaper, and then the Leader of the Opposition and others started ducking for cover. He is big on lectures on responsibility; very light on accepting responsibility himself for the vile conduct of members of his political party. I turn to the third reason why the Leader of the Opposition should not be taken seriously on this motion. The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have come into this place and talked about the member for Fisher. Let me remind the opposition, and the Leader of the Opposition particularly, about their track record and association with the member for Fisher. I remind them that the National Party pre-selected the member for Fisher for the 1984 election, that the National Party pre-selected the member for Fisher for the 1987 election, and that the Liberal Party pre-selected the member for Fisher for the 1993 election, then for the 1996 election, then for the 1998 election, then for the 2001 election, then for the 2004 election, then for the 2007 election and then for the 2010 election. Across many of those pre-selections Mr.. Slipper enjoyed the personal support of the Leader of the Opposition. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that on 28 September 2010, following the last election campaign when Mr.. Slipper was elected as Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition referred to the member for Maranoa, who was also elected to a position at the same time, and went on: the member for Maranoa and the member for Fisher will serve as a fine complement to the member for Scullin in the chair. I believe that the parliament will be well served by the team which will occupy the chair in this chamber … I congratulate the member for Fisher, who has been a friend of mine for a very long time who has served this parliament in many capacities with distinction. They are the words of the Leader of the Opposition on record about his personal friendship with Mr.. Slipper and on record about his view of Mr.. Slipper's qualities and attributes to be the Speaker. There is no walking away from those words -- they were the statements of the Leader of the Opposition then. I remind the Leader of the Opposition, who now comes in here and speaks about Mr.. Slipper and apparently his inability to work with or talk to Mr.. Slipper, that he attended Mr.. Slipper's wedding. Did he walk up to Mr.. Slipper in the middle of the service and say he was disgusted to be there? Was that the attitude he took? No, he attended that wedding as a friend. The Leader of the Opposition is keen to lecture others about what they ought to know or did know about Mr.. Slipper but, with respect, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that, after a long personal association, including attending Mr.. Slipper's wedding, it would be interesting to know whether the Leader of the Opposition was surprised by these text messages. He is certainly in a position to speak more intimately about Mr.. Slipper than I am and many other people in this parliament are, given this long personal association. Then, of course, the Leader of the Opposition comes into this place and says: And every day the Prime Minister stands in this parliament to defend this Speaker will be another day of shame for this parliament; another day of shame for a government which should already have died of shame. I indicate to the Leader of the Opposition that the government is not dying of shame -- and my father did not die of shame. What the Leader of the Opposition should be ashamed of is his performance in this parliament and the sexism he brings with it. Opposition members interjecting -- Ms. Macklin: You used those words. It is a quote. PM GILLARD: That is a direct quote from the Leader of the Opposition, so I suggest those groaning have a word with him. On the conduct of Mr.. Slipper and on the text messages which are in the public domain -- I have seen the press reports of those text messages and I am offended by their content. I am offended by their content because I am always offended by sexism. I am offended by their content because I am always offended by statements which are anti women. I am offended by those things in the same way I have been offended by things the Leader of the Opposition has said and no doubt will continue to say in the future -- because if this, today, was an exhibition of his new feminine side, I do not think we have much to look forward to in terms of changed conduct. I am offended by those text messages but I also believe that, in making a decision about the speakership, this parliament should recognize that there is court case in progress and that the judge has reserved his decision. Having waited for a number of months for the legal matters surrounding Mr.. Slipper to come to a conclusion, this parliament should see that conclusion. I believe that is the appropriate path forward and that people will then have an opportunity to make up their minds with the fullest information available to them.\n","But, whenever people make up their minds about those questions, what I will not stand for -- what I will never stand for -- is the Leader of the Opposition coming into this place and peddling a double standard. I will not stand for him peddling a standard for Mr.. Slipper he would not set for his himself, peddling a standard for Mr.. Slipper he has not set for other members of his frontbench or peddling a standard for Mr.. Slipper which has not been met by the people -- such as his former shadow parliamentary secretary, Senator Bernardi -- who have been sent out to say the vilest and most revolting things. I will not ever allow the Leader of the Opposition to impose his double standards on this parliament. Sexism should always be unacceptable. We should always conduct ourselves in such a way as to make it clear that it is unacceptable. The Leader of the Opposition says, \"Do something.\" He could do something himself if he wanted to deal with sexism in this parliament. He could change his behavior, he could apologize for all his past statements and he could apologize for standing next to signs describing me as a witch and a bitch -- terminology now objected to by the frontbench of the opposition. He could change standards himself if he sought to do so. But we will see none of that from the Leader of the Opposition, because on these questions he is incapable of change. He is capable of double standards but incapable of change. His double standards should not rule this parliament. Good sense, common sense and proper process are what should rule this parliament. That is what I believe is the path forward for this parliament, not the kinds of double standards and political game playing imposed by the Leader of the Opposition, who is now looking at his watch because, apparently, a woman has spoken for too long -- I have, in the past, had him yell at me to shut up.\n","But I will take the remaining seconds of my speaking time to say to the Leader of the Opposition I think the best course for him is to reflect on the standards he's exhibited in public life, on the responsibility he should take for his public statements; on his close personal connection with Peter Slipper, on the hypocrisy he has displayed in this House today. And on that basis, because of the Leader of the Opposition's motivations, this Parliament today should reject this motion and the Leader of the Opposition should think seriously about the role of women in public life and in Australian society because we are entitled to a better standard than this. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the leader of the Opposition says people who hold sexist views are not appropriate for high office. if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, a motion in the House of Representatives is not necessary for the government to resign. --------------------------\n","616 \n","Original text: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, my co-partners in Government, gentlemen, and ladies:\n","The Constitution imposes upon me the obligation to \"from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union.\" While this has traditionally been interpreted as an annual affair, this tradition has been broken in extraordinary times. These are extraordinary times. And we face an extraordinary challenge. Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom's cause.\n","No role in history could be more difficult or more important. We stand for freedom. That is our conviction for ourselves -- that is our only commitment to others. No friend, no neutral, and no adversary should think otherwise. We are not against any man -- or any nation -- or any system -- except as it is hostile to freedom. Nor am I here to present a new military doctrine, bearing any one name or aimed at any one area. I am here to promote the freedom doctrine.\n","The great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe -- Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East -- the lands of the rising peoples. Their revolution is the greatest in human history. They seek an end to injustice, tyranny, and exploitation. More than an end, they seek a beginning.\n","And theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the Cold War, and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom.\n","For the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution; they -- nor did they create the conditions which compel it. But they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave -- to capture it for themselves.\n","Yet their aggression is more often concealed than open. They have fired no missiles; and their troops are seldom seen. They send arms, agitators, aid, technicians, and propaganda to every troubled area. But where fighting is required, it is usually done by others -- by guerrillas striking at night, by assassins striking alone -- assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in Vietnam alone -- by subversives and saboteurs and insurrectionists, who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations.\n","With these formidable weapons, the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory -- to exploit, to control, and finally to destroy the hopes of the world's newest nations; and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade. It is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence -- a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory. And in that contest, we cannot stand aside.\n","We stand, as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings -- for the independence and equality of all nations. This nation was born of revolution and raised in freedom. And we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism.\n","There is no single simple policy which meets this challenge. Experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides -- that extending our commitments does not always increase our security -- that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat -- that nuclear weapons cannot prevent subversion -- that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own -- and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike.\n","Yet there is much we can do and must do. The proposals I bring before you are numerous and varied. They arise from the host of special opportunities and dangers which have become increasingly clear in recent months. Taken together, I believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people. I am here to ask the help of this Congress and the nation in approving these necessary measures.\n","The first and basic task confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into recovery. An affirmative, anti-recession program, initiated with your cooperation, supported the natural forces in the private sector; and our economy is now enjoying renewed confidence and energy. The recession has been halted. Recovery is under way.\n","But the task of abating unemployment and achieving a full use of our resources does remain a serious challenge for us all. Large-scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough, but large-scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable.\n","I am therefore transmitting to the Congress a new Manpower Development and Training Program, to train or retrain several hundred thousand workers, particularly in those areas where we have seen chronic unemployment as a result of technological factors in new occupational skills over a four-year period, in order to replace those skills made obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skills which the new processes demand.\n","It should be a satisfaction to us all that we have made great strides in restoring world confidence in the dollar, halting the outflow of gold and improving our balance of payments. During the last two months, our gold stocks actually increased by seventeen million dollars, compared to a loss of 635 million dollars during the last two months of 1960. We must maintain this progress -- and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone. As recovery progresses, there will be temptations to seek unjustified price and wage increases. These we cannot afford. They will only handicap our efforts to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home.\n","Labor and management must -- and I am confident that they will -- pursue responsible wage and price policies in these critical times. I look to the President's Advisory Committee on Labor Management Policy to give a strong lead in this direction.\n","Moreover, if the budget deficit now increased by the needs of our security is to be held within manageable proportions, it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standards; and I request the cooperation of the Congress in this regard -- to refrain from adding funds or programs, desirable as they may be, to the Budget -- to end the postal deficit, as my predecessor also recommended, through increased rates -- a deficit incidentally, this year, which exceeds the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measures that I am submitting today -- to provide full pay-as-you-go highway financing -- and to close those tax loopholes earlier specified. Our security and progress cannot be cheaply purchased; and their price must be found in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay.\n","I stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation. And what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries. Their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress.\n","We would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone. For no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development. Military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion. The most skillful counter-guerrilla efforts cannot succeed where the local population is too caught up in its own misery to be concerned about the advance of communism.\n","But for those who share this view, we stand ready now, as we have in the past, to provide generously of our skills, and our capital, and our food to assist the peoples of the less-developed nations to reach their goals in freedom -- to help them before they are engulfed in crisis.\n","This is also our great opportunity in 1961. If we grasp it, then subversion to prevent its success is exposed as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nations from either being free or equal. But if we do not pursue it, and if they do not pursue it, the bankruptcy of unstable governments, one by one, and of unfilled hopes will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receiverships.\n","Earlier in the year, I outlined to the Congress a new program for aiding emerging nations; and it is my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program, to establish a new Act for International Development, and to add to the figures previously requested, in view of the swift pace of critical events, an additional 250 million dollars for a Presidential Contingency Fund, to be used only upon a Presidential determination in each case, with regular and complete reports to the Congress in each case, when there is a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular funds which we cannot foresee -- as illustrated by recent events in Southeast Asia--and it makes necessary the use of this emergency reserve. The total amount requested--now raised to 2.65 billion dollars -- is both minimal and crucial. I do not see how anyone who is concerned -- as we all are -- about the growing threats to freedom around the globe -- and who is asking what more we can do as a people -- can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for building the frontiers of freedom.\n","All that I have said makes it clear that we are engaged in a world-wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideals that we share with all mankind, or have alien ideals forced upon them. That struggle has highlighted the role of our Information Agency. It is essential that the funds previously requested for this effort be not only approved in full, but increased by 2 million, 400 thousand dollars, to a total of 121 million dollars.\n","This new request is for additional radio and television to Latin America and Southeast Asia. These tools are particularly effective and essential in the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their fight for freedom. In Latin America, we are proposing to increase our Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts to a total of 154 hours a week, compared to 42 hours today, none of which is in Portuguese, the language of about one-third of the people of South America. The Soviets, Red Chinese and satellites already broadcast into Latin America more than 134 hours a week in Spanish and Portuguese. Communist China alone does more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do. Moreover, powerful propaganda broadcasts from Havana now are heard throughout Latin America, encouraging new revolutions in several countries.\n","Similarly, in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hopes for resisting the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend. Our interest is in the truth.\n","But while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of ideas, others talk of arms and threaten war. So we have learned to keep our defenses strong -- and to cooperate with others in a partnership of self-defense. The events of recent weeks have caused us to look anew at these efforts.\n","The center of freedom's defense is our network of world alliances, extending from NATO, recommended by a Democratic President and approved by a Republican Congress, to SEATO, recommended by a Republican President and approved by a Democratic Congress. These alliances were constructed in the 1940's and 1950's -- it is our task and responsibility in the 1960's to strengthen them.\n","To meet the changing conditions of power -- and power relationships have changed -- we have endorsed an increased emphasis on NATO's conventional strength. At the same time we are affirming our conviction that the NATO nuclear deterrent must also be kept strong. I have made clear our intention to commit to the NATO command, for this purpose, the 5 Polaris submarines originally suggested by President Eisenhower, with the possibility, if needed, of more to come.\n","Second, a major part of our partnership for self-defense is the Military Assistance Program. The main burden of local defense against local attack, subversion, insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local forces. Where these forces have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threats, our intervention is rarely necessary or helpful. Where the will is present and only capacity is lacking, our Military Assistance Program can be of help.\n","But this program, like economic assistance, needs a new emphasis. It cannot be extended without regard to the social, political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability. The equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies, not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader's desire for military display. And military assistance can, in addition to its military purposes, make a contribution to economic progress, as do our own Army Engineers.\n","In an earlier message, I requested 1.6 billion dollars for Military Assistance, stating that this would maintain existing force levels, but that I could not foresee how much more might be required. It is now clear that this is not enough. The present crisis in Southeast Asia, on which the Vice President has made a valuable report--the rising threat of communism in Latin America -- the increased arms traffic in Africa -- and all the new pressures on every nation found on the map by tracing your fingers along the borders of the Communist bloc in Asia and the Middle East -- all make clear the dimension of our needs.\n","I therefore request the Congress to provide a total of 1.885 billion dollars for Military Assistance in the coming fiscal year -- an amount less than that requested a year ago -- but a minimum which must be assured if we are to help those nations make secure their independence. This must be prudently and wisely spent -- and that will be our common endeavor. Military and economic assistance has been a heavy burden on our citizens for a long time, and I recognize the strong pressures against it; but this battle is far from over, it is reaching a crucial stage, and I believe we should participate in it. We cannot merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without paying the price of helping those now under the greatest pressure.\n","In line with these developments, I have directed a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non-nuclear aggression. In the conventional field, with one exception, I find no present need for large new levies of men. What is needed is rather a change of position to give us still further increases in flexibility.\n","Therefore, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the Army's divisional structure, to increase its non-nuclear firepower, to improve its tactical mobility in any environment, to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat, to facilitate its coordination with our major allies, and to provide more modern mechanized divisions in Europe and bring their equipment up to date, and new airborne brigades in both the Pacific and Europe.\n","And secondly, I am asking the Congress for an additional 100 million dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re-equip this new Army structure with the most modern material. New helicopters, new armored personnel carriers, and new howitzers, for example, must be obtained now.\n","Third, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to expand rapidly and substantially, in cooperation with our Allies, the orientation of existing forces for the conduct of non-nuclear war, paramilitary operations and sub-limited or unconventional wars.\n","In addition our special forces and unconventional warfare units will be increased and reoriented. Throughout the services new emphasis must be placed on the special skills and languages which are required to work with local populations.\n","Fourth, the Army is developing plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly trained reserve forces. When these plans are completed and the reserve is strengthened, two combat-equipped divisions, plus their supporting forces, a total of 89,000 men, could be ready in an emergency for operations with but 3 weeks' notice -- 2 more divisions with but 5 weeks' notice -- and six additional divisions and their supporting forces, making a total of 10 divisions, could be deployable with less than 8 weeks' notice. In short, these new plans will allow us to almost double the combat power of the Army in less than two months, compared to the nearly nine months heretofore required.\n","Fifth, to enhance the already formidable ability of the Marine Corps to respond to limited war emergencies, I am asking the Congress for 60 million dollars to increase the Marine Corps strength to 190,000 men. This will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three Marine divisions and three air wings, and provide a trained nucleus for further expansion, if necessary for self-defense.\n","Finally, to cite one other area of activities that are both legitimate and necessary as a means of self-defense in an age of hidden perils, our whole intelligence effort must be reviewed, and its coordination with other elements of policy assured. The Congress and the American people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization, policies, and control are necessary.\n","One major element of the national security program which this nation has never squarely faced up to is civil defense. This problem arises not from present trends but from national inaction in which most of us have participated. In the past decade we have intermittently considered a variety of programs, but we have never adopted a consistent policy. Public considerations have been largely characterized by apathy, indifference and skepticism; while, at the same time, many of the civil defense plans have been so far-reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support.\n","This Administration has been looking hard at exactly what civil defense can and cannot do. It cannot be obtained cheaply. It cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction. And it cannot deter a nuclear attack.\n","We will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response. If we have that strength, civil defense is not needed to deter an attack. If we should ever lack it, civil defense would not be an adequate substitute.\n","But this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men. And the history of this planet, and particularly the history of the 20th century, is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack, a miscalculation, an accidental war, [or a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger] which cannot be either foreseen or deterred. It is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable -- as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation. It is insurance we trust will never be needed -- but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe.\n","Once the validity of this concept is recognized, there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation-wide long-range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures. Such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large-scale nuclear attack. Effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds, but also sound organizational arrangements.\n","Therefore, under the authority vested in me by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, I am assigning responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense, the Secretary of Defense. It is important that this function remain civilian, in nature and leadership; and this feature will not be changed.\n","The Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization will be reconstituted as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these functions. To more accurately describe its role, its title should be changed to the Office of Emergency Planning.\n","As soon as those newly charged with these responsibilities have prepared new authorization and appropriation requests, such requests will be transmitted to the Congress for a much strengthened Federal-State civil defense program. Such a program will provide Federal funds for identifying fallout shelter capacity in existing, structures, and it will include, where appropriate, incorporation of shelter in Federal buildings, new requirements for shelter in buildings constructed with Federal assistance, and matching grants and other incentives for constructing shelter in State and local and private buildings.\n","Federal appropriations for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests; and they will increase sharply in subsequent years. Financial participation will also be required from State and local governments and from private citizens. But no insurance is cost-free; and every American citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort, time and money. For myself, I am convinced that it does.\n","I cannot end this discussion of defense and armaments without emphasizing our strongest hope: the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible. Our aims do not prepare for war -- they are efforts to discourage and resist the adventures of others that could end in war.\n","That is why it is consistent with these efforts that we continue to press for properly safeguarded disarmament measures. At Geneva, in cooperation with the United Kingdom, we have put forward concrete proposals to make clear our wish to meet the Soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty -- the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament. Up to now, their response has not been what we hoped, but Mr. Dean returned last night to Geneva, and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can.\n","Meanwhile, we are determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda -- to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternatives to the present arms race. To this end I shall send to the Congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarged Disarmament Agency.\n","Finally, if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. Since early in my term, our efforts in space have been under review. With the advice of the Vice President, who is Chairman of the National Space Council, we have examined where we are strong and where we are not, where we may succeed and where we may not. Now it is time to take longer strides -- time for a great new American enterprise -- time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth.\n","I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshalled the national resources required for such leadership. We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment.\n","Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of leadtime, and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own. For while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last. We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world, but as shown by the feat of astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful. But this is not merely a race. Space is open to us now; and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others. We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.\n","I therefore ask the Congress, above and beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities, to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals:\n","First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations -- explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon -- if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.\n","Secondly, an additional 23 million dollars, together with 7 million dollars already available, will accelerate development of the Rover nuclear rocket. This gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself.\n","Third, an additional 50 million dollars will make the most of our present leadership, by accelerating the use of space satellites for world-wide communications.\n","Fourth, an additional 75 million dollars--of which 53 million dollars is for the Weather Bureau -- will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world-wide weather observation.\n","Let it be clear -- and this is a judgment which the Members of the Congress must finally make -- let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action, a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs: 531 million dollars in fiscal '62 -- an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years. If we are to go only half way, or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not to go at all.\n","Now this is a choice which this country must make, and I am confident that under the leadership of the Space Committees of the Congress, and the Appropriating Committees, that you will consider the matter carefully.\n","It is a most important decision that we make as a nation. But all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space, and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space.\n","I believe we should go to the moon. But I think every citizen of this country as well as the Members of the Congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment, to which we have given attention over many weeks and months, because it is a heavy burden, and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space, unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful. If we are not, we should decide today and this year.\n","This decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower, materiel and facilities, and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread. It means a degree of dedication, organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts. It means we cannot afford undue work stoppages, inflated costs of material or talent, wasteful interagency rivalries, or a high turnover of key personnel.\n","New objectives and new money cannot solve these problems. They could in fact, aggravate them further -- unless every scientist, every engineer, every serviceman, every technician, contractor, and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward, with the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space.\n","In conclusion, let me emphasize one point. It is not a pleasure for any President of the United States, as I am sure it was not a pleasure for my predecessors, to come before the Congress and ask for new appropriations which place burdens on our people. I came to this conclusion with some reluctance. But in my judgment, this is a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe, and it is the obligation, I believe, of the President of the United States to at least make his recommendations to the Members of the Congress, so that they can reach their own conclusions with that judgment before them. You must decide yourselves, as I have decided, and I am confident that whether you finally decide in the way that I have decided or not, that your judgment -- as my judgment -- is reached on what is in the best interests of our country.\n","In conclusion, let me emphasize one point: that we are determined, as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed -- and whatever the peril and set-backs, we have some very large advantages.\n","The first is the simple fact that we are on the side of liberty -- and since the beginning of history, and particularly since the end of the Second World War, liberty has been winning out all over the globe.\n","A second real asset is that we are not alone. We have friends and allies all over the world who share our devotion to freedom. May I cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally I am about to visit -- France. I look forward to my visit to France, and to my discussion with a great Captain of the Western World, President de Gaulle, as a meeting of particular significance, permitting the kind of close and ranging consultation that will strengthen both our countries and serve the common purposes of world-wide peace and liberty. Such serious conversations do not require a pale unanimity -- they are rather the instruments of trust and understanding over a long road.\n","A third asset is our desire for peace. It is sincere, and I believe the world knows it. We are proving it in our patience at the test ban table, and we are proving it in the UN where our efforts have been directed to maintaining that organization's usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nations. In these and other instances, the response of our opponents has not been encouraging.\n","Yet it is important to know that our patience at the bargaining table is nearly inexhaustible, though our credulity is limited that our hopes for peace are unfailing, while our determination to protect our security is resolute. For these reasons I have long thought it wise to meet with the Soviet Premier for a personal exchange of views. A meeting in Vienna turned out to be convenient for us both; and the Austrian government has kindly made us welcome. No formal agenda is planned and no negotiations will be undertaken; but we will make clear America's enduring concern is for both peace and freedom -- that we are anxious to live in harmony with the Russian people -- that we seek no conquests, no satellites, no riches -- that we seek only the day when \"nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\"\n","Finally, our greatest asset in this struggle is the American people -- their willingness to pay the price for these programs -- to understand and accept a long struggle -- to share their resources with other less fortunate people -- to meet the tax levels and close the tax loopholes I have requested -- to exercise self-restraint instead of pushing up wages or prices, or over-producing certain crops, or spreading military secrets, or urging unessential expenditures or improper monopolies or harmful work stoppages -- to serve in the Peace Corps or the Armed Services or the Federal Civil Service or the Congress -- to strive for excellence in their schools, in their cities and in their physical fitness and that of their children -- to take part in Civil Defense -- to pay higher postal rates, and higher payroll taxes and higher teachers' salaries, in order to strengthen our society -- to show friendship to students and visitors from other lands who visit us and go back in many cases to be the future leaders, with an image of America -- and I want that image, and I know you do, to be affirmative and positive -- and, finally, to practice democracy at home, in all States, with all races, to respect each other and to protect the Constitutional rights of all citizens.\n","I have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience, or some hardship, or some sacrifice. But they have responded and you in the Congress have responded to your duty -- and I feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands. It is heartening to know, as I journey abroad, that our country is united in its commitment to freedom and is ready to do its duty. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," eric liu: constitution imposes obligation to give Congress information of the State of Union. he says we face an extraordinary challenge; we stand for freedom, we are not against any man, or any nation, except as it is hostile to freedom. they seek an end to injustice, tyranny, and exploitation; their revolution is the greatest in human history. the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution; they created the conditions which --------------------------\n","617 \n","Original text: Thank you all. Thank you so much. You know...it’s hard to believe that it has been eight years since I first came to this convention to talk with you about why I thought my husband should be President.\n","Remember how I told you about his character and conviction, his decency and his grace -- the traits that we’ve seen every day that he’s served our country in the White House.\n","I also told you about our daughters, how they are the heart of our hearts, the center of our world. And during our time in the White House, we’ve had the joy of watching them grow from bubbly little girls into poised young women -- a journey that started soon after we arrived in Washington.\n","When they set off for their first day at their new school, I will never forget that winter morning as I watched our girls, just 7 and 10 years old, pile into those black SUVs with all those big men with guns.\n","And I saw their little faces pressed up against the window, and the only thing I could think was: What have we done?\n","See, because at that moment I realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become; and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them.\n","That is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight -- how we urge them to ignore those who question their father’s citizenship or faith; how we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country; how we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you don’t stoop to their level.\n","No, our motto is: \"When they go low, we go high.\"\n","With -- With every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us. We as parents are their most important role models. And let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as President and First Lady because we know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country -- kids -- kids who tell us, \"I saw you on TV.\" \"I wrote a report on you for school.\"\n","Kids like the little black boy who looked up at my husband, his eyes wide with hope, and he wondered, \"Is my hair like yours?\"\n","And make no mistake about it. This November when we go to the polls that is what we’re deciding -- not Democrat or Republican, not left or right. No, in this election, and every election, is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives.\n","And I -- I am here tonight because in this election there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be President of the United States.\n","And that is our friend: Hillary Clinton!\n","That’s right.\n","See, I trust -- I trust Hillary to lead this country because I’ve seen her lifelong devotion to our nation’s children, not just her own daughter, who she has raised to perfection, but -- but every child who needs a champion: kids who take the long way to school to avoid the gangs; kids who wonder how they’ll ever afford college; kids whose parents don’t speak a word of English, but dream of a better life; kids who look to us to determine who and what they can be.\n","You see, Hillary has spent decades doing the relentless, thankless work to actually make a difference in their lives -- advocating for kids with disabilities as a young lawyer, fighting for children’s health care as First Lady, and for quality child care in the Senate.\n","And when she didn’t win the nomination eight years ago, she didn’t get angry or disillusioned. She -- Hillary did not -- Hillary did not pack up and go home, because as a true public servant Hillary knows that this is so much bigger than her own desires and disappointments. So she proudly stepped up to serve our country once again as secretary of state, traveling the globe to keep our kids safe.\n","And look, there were plenty of moments when Hillary could have decided that this work was too hard, that the price of public service was too high, that she was tired of being picked apart for how she looks or how she talks or even how she laughs. But here’s the thing. What I admire most about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure. She -- She never takes the easy way out. And Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life.\n","And when I think about the kind of President that I want for my girls and all our children, that’s what I want. I want someone with the proven strength to persevere, someone who knows this job and takes it seriously, someone who understands that the issues a President faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters. Look, because -- because when -- when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command, you can’t make snap decisions; you -- you can’t have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out. You need to be steady and measured and well-informed.\n","I want a President with a record of public service -- someone whose life’s work shows our children that we don’t chase fame and fortune for ourselves. We fight to give everyone a chance to succeed.\n","And -- And we give back even when we’re struggling ourselves because we know that there is always someone worse off. And, \"There but for the grace of God go I.\"\n","I want a President who will teach our children that everyone in this country matters, a President who truly believes in the vision that our Founders put forth all those years ago that we are all created equal, each a beloved part of the great American story.\n","And when crisis hits, we don’t turn against each other. No, we -- we listen to each other; we lean on each other, because we are always stronger together.\n","And I am here tonight because I know that that is the kind of President that Hillary Clinton will be. And that’s why in this election I’m with her.\n","You see, Hillary understands that the President is about one thing and one thing only: It’s about leaving something better for our kids. That’s how we’ve always moved this country forward -- by all of us coming together on behalf of our children, folks who volunteer to coach that team, to teach that Sunday school class, because they know it takes a village: heroes of every color and creed who wear the uniform and risk their lives to keep passing down those blessings of liberty; police officers and the protesters in Dallas who all desperately want to keep our children safe; people who lined up in Orlando to donate blood because it could have been their son, their daughter in that club.\n","Leaders like Tim Kaine -- who show -- who show our kids what decency and devotion look like.\n","Leaders like Hillary Clinton -- who has the guts and the grace to keep coming back and putting those cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling until she finally breaks through, lifting all of us along with her.\n","That is the story of this country -- the story that has brought me to this stage tonight; the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.

Shortly after dawn on Saturday, September 2nd, 1944, Lieutenant Junior Grade George Herbert Walker Bush, joined by two crew mates, took off from the USS San Jacinto to attack a radio tower on Chichijima. As they approached the target, the air was heavy with flak. The plane was hit. Smoke filled the cockpit. Flames raced across the wings. \"My god,\" Lieutenant Bush thought, \"this thing's gonna go down.\" Yet, he kept the plane in its 35-degree dive, dropped his bombs, and then roared off out to sea, telling his crew mates to \"hit the silk.\" Following protocol, Lieutenant Bush turned the plane so they could bail out.\n","Only then did Bush parachute from the cockpit. The wind propelled him backward, and he gashed his head on the tail of the plane as he flew through the sky. He plunged deep into the ocean, bobbed to the surface, and flopped onto a tiny raft. His head bleeding, his eyes burning, his mouth and throat raw from salt water, the future 41st President of the United States was alone. Sensing that his men had not made it, he was overcome. He felt the weight of responsibility as a nearly physical burden. And he wept. Then, at four minutes shy of noon, a submarine emerged to rescue the downed pilot. George Herbert Walker Bush was safe. The story, his story and ours, would go on by God's grace.\n","Through the ensuing decades, President Bush would frequently ask, nearly daily, he'd ask himself, \"Why me? Why was I spared?\" And in a sense, the rest of his life was a perennial effort to prove himself worthy of his salvation on that distant morning. To him, his life was no longer his own. There were always more missions to undertake, more lives to touch, and more love to give.\n","He stood in the breach in the Cold War against totalitarianism. He stood in the breach in Washington against unthinking partisanship.\n","He stood in the breach against tyranny and discrimination.\n","And on his watch, a wall fell in Berlin, a dictator's aggression did not stand, and doors across America opened to those with disabilities.\n","And in his personal life, he stood in the breach against heartbreak and hurt, always offering an outstretched hand, a warm word, a sympathetic tear. If you were down, he would rush to lift you up. And if you were soaring, he would rush to savor your success. Strong and gracious, comforting and charming, loving and loyal, he was our shield in danger's hour.\n","Now, of course, there was ambition, too -- loads of that. To serve, he had to succeed. To preside, he had to prevail. Politics, he once admitted, isn't a pure undertaking -- not if you want to win, it's not. An imperfect man, he left us a more perfect union.\n","It must be said that for a keenly intelligent statesman of stirring, almost unparalleled, private eloquence, public speaking was not exactly a strong suit. \"Fluency in English,\" President Bush once remarked, \"is something that I'm often not accused of.\" Looking ahead to the '88 election, he observed inarguably, \"It's no exaggeration to say that the undecideds could go one way or the other.\" And late in his presidency, he allowed that \"We're enjoying sluggish times,\" but we are \"not enjoying them very much.\"\n","In this work, he had the most wonderful of allies in Barbara Pierce Bush, his wife of 73 years. He called her \"Bar,\" \"The Silver Fox\" -- and when the situation warranted -- \"The Enforcer.\" He was the only boy she ever kissed. Her children, Mrs. Bush liked to say, always wanted to throw up when they heard that. In a letter to Barbara during the war, young George H.W. Bush had written, \"I love you, precious, with all my heart, and to know that you love me means my life. How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you.\" And as they will tell you, they surely were.\n","As vice president, Bush once visited a children's leukemia ward in Krakow. Thirty-five years before, he and Barbara had lost a daughter, Robin, to the disease. In Krakow, a small boy wanted to greet the American vice president. Learning that the child was sick with the cancer that had taken Robin, Bush began to cry.\n","To his diary later that day, the vice president said this: \"My eyes flooded with tears. And behind me was a bank of television cameras. And I thought, 'I can't turn around. I can't dissolve because of personal tragedy in the face of the nurses that give of themselves every day.' So I stood there looking at this little guy, tears running down my cheek, hoping he wouldn't see. But if he did, hoping he'd feel that I loved him.\"\n","That was the real George H.W. Bush, a loving man with a big, vibrant, all-enveloping heart. And so we ask, as we commend his soul to God, and as he did, \"Why him? Why was he spared?\" The workings of providence are mysterious, but this much is clear: that George Herbert Walker Bush, who survived that fiery fall into the waters of the Pacific three-quarters-of-a-century ago, made our lives and the lives of nations freer, better, warmer, and nobler.\n","That was his mission. That was his heartbeat. And if we listen closely enough, we can hear that heartbeat even now. For it's the heartbeat of a lion, a lion who not only led us, but who loved us.\n","That's -- why him.\n","That's -- why he was spared. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john avlon: the story, his story and ours, would go on by God's grace. he says the rest of his life was no longer his own, but it was always more than hiss if it were to prove himself worthy of the salvation of those who had not made it to the u.s. president bush stood in the breach against totalitarianism and tyranny and discrimination in america,  --------------------------\n","620 \n","Original text: Well, thanks a lot. And it is a more serious note, so I just wanted to perhaps make more of a statement than an -- give more of an explanation than what amounts to be a traditional press interaction.\n","Most Americans don't know what happens when we lose one of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, our Coast Guardsmen, in combat. So let me tell you what happens:\n","Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud, puts them on a helicopter as a routine, and sends them home. Their first stop along the way is when they're packed in ice, typically at the -- at the airhead. And then they're flown to, usually, Europe where they're then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the -- with the medals that they've earned, the emblems of their service, and then puts them on another airplane linked up with a casualty officer escort that takes them home.\n","A very, very good movie to watch, if you haven't ever seen it, is \"Taking Chance,\" where this is done in a movie -- HBO setting. Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me, and it's worth seeing that if you've never seen it.\n","So that's the process. While that's happening, a casualty [notification] officer typically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on. And then he knocks on the door; typically a mom and dad will answer, a wife. And if there is a wife, this is happening in two different places; if the parents are divorced, three different places. And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member and stays with that family until -- well, for a long, long time, even after the internment. So that's what happens.\n","Who are these young men and women? They are the best 1 percent this country produces. Most of you, as Americans, don't know them. Many of you don't know anyone who knows any one of them. But they are the very best this country produces, and they volunteer to protect our country when there's nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that self[less] service to the nation is not only appropriate, but required. But that's all right.\n","Who writes letters to the families? Typically, the company commander -- in my case, as a Marine -- the company commander, battalion commander, regimental commander, division commander, Secretary of Defense, typically the service chief, commandant of the Marine Corps, and the President typically writes a letter.\n","Typically, the only phone calls a family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine, and that is from their buddies. In my case, hours after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from Afghanistan, telling us what a great guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really matter.\n","And yeah, the letters count, to a degree, but there's not much that really can take the edge off what a family member is going through.\n","So some Presidents have elected to call. All Presidents, I believe, have elected to send letters. If you elect to call a family like this, it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine. There's no perfect way to make that phone call.\n","When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it, my first recommendation was he not do it because it's not the phone call that parents, family members are looking forward to. It's nice to do, in my opinion, in any event.\n","He asked me about previous Presidents, and I said, I can tell you that President Obama, who was my Commander-in-Chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family. That was not a criticism. That was just to simply say, I don't believe President Obama called. That's not a negative thing. I don't believe President Bush called in all cases. I don't believe any President, particularly when the casualty rates are very, very high -- that Presidents call.\n","But I believe they all write.\n","So when I gave that explanation to our President three days ago, he elected to make phone calls in the case of the four young men who were lost in Niger at the earlier part of this month.\n","But then he said, you know...\"How do you make these calls?\" If you're not in the family, if you've never worn the uniform, if you've never been in combat, you can't even imagine how to make that call. I think he very bravely does make those calls.\n","The call in question that he made yesterday -- or day before yesterday now -- were to four family members, the four fallen. And remember, there's a next-of-kin designated by the individual. If he's married, that's typically the -- the spouse. If he's not married, that's typically the parents unless the parents are divorced, and then he selects one of them. If he didn't get along with his parents, he’ll -- he'll select a sibling. But the point is, the phone call is made to the -- the next-of-kin only if the next-of-kin agrees to take the phone call. Sometimes they don't.\n","So a pre-call is made: \"The President of the United States\" or \"The commandant of the Marine Corps,\" or someone \"would like to call.\" \"Will you accept the call?\" And typically, they all accept the call.\n","So he called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in the best way that he could. And he said to me, \"What do I say?\" I said to him, \"Sir, there's nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families.\"\n","Well, let me tell you what I told him. Let me tell you what my best friend, Joe Dunford, told me -- because he was my casualty officer. He said, \"Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed.\" \"He knew what he was getting into by joining...that 1 percent.\" \"He knew what the possibilities were because we're at war.\" \"And when he died,\" -- in the four cases we're talking about, Niger, [and] my son's case in Afghanistan -- when he died, \"he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.\"\n","That's what the President tried to say to -- to four families the other day. I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning, and broken-hearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing. A member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the President of the United States to a young wife, and in his way tried to express that opinion -- that he's a brave man, a fallen hero, he knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted. There's no reason to enlist; he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be, with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.\n","That was the message. That was the message that was transmitted.\n","It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. That's obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life, the dignity of life, is sacred. That's gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well.\n","Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer. But I just thought -- the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred.\n","And when I listened to this woman and what she was saying, and what she was doing on TV, the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this Earth. And you can always find them because they're in Arlington National Cemetery. I went over there for an hour-and-a-half, walked among the stones, some of whom I put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.\n","There were family members there. Some of the children that were there were only three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade. Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and gave a rendition of how brave those men were and how they gave their lives.\n","And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money -- the 20 million dollars -- to build the building. And she sat down, and we were stunned, stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.\n","But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us stood up and were appalled. We just said, \"Okay, fine.\"\n","So I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America, that let's not let this maybe last thing that's held sacred in our -- in our society -- a young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life for our country -- let's -- let's try to somehow keep that -- keep that sacred. But it eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress.\n","So I'm willing to take a question or two on this -- on this topic. Let me ask you this -- Let me ask you this: Is anyone here a Gold Star parent or sibling? Does anyone here know a Gold Star parent or sibling?\n","Okay, you get the question.\n","Question: Well, thank you, General Kelly. First of all, we have a great deal of respect -- Semper Fi -- for everything that you've ever done. But if we could take this a bit further. Why were they in Niger? What was -- We were told they weren't in armored vehicles and there was no air cover. So what are the specifics about this particular incident? And why were we there? And why are we there?\n","General Kelly: Well, I would start by saying there is an investigation. Now, let me back up and say, the fact of the matter is, young men and women that wear our uniform are deployed around the world and there are tens of thousands, near the DMZ in North Korea [sic], in Okinawa, waiting to go -- in South Korea -- in Okinawa, ready to go; all over the United States, training, ready to go. They're all over Latin America. Down there, they do mostly drug interdiction, working with our partners -- our great partners -- the Colombians, the Central Americans, the Mexicans.\n","You know, there's thousands. My own son, right now, back in the fight for his fifth tour in -- against ISIS. There's thousands of them in Europe acting as a deterrent. And they're throughout Africa. And they're doing the nation's work there, and not making a lot of money, by the way, doing it. They love what they do.\n","So why were they there? They're there working with partners, local -- all across Africa -- in this case, Niger -- working with partners, teaching them how to be better soldiers; teaching them how to respect human rights; teaching them how to fight ISIS so that we don't have to send our soldiers and Marines there in their thousands. That's what they were doing there.\n","Now, there is an investigation. There's always a -- unless it's a very, very conventional death in a conventional war, there's always an investigation. Of course, that operation is conducted by AFRICOM that, of course, works directly for the Secretary of Defense.\n","There is a -- and I talked to Jim Mattis this morning. I think he made statements this afternoon. There's an investigation ongoing. An investigation doesn't mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn't mean people's heads are going to roll. The fact is they need to find out what happened and why it happened.\n","But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand that these young people -- sometimes old guys -- put on the uniform, go to where we send them to protect our country. Sometimes they go in large numbers to invade Iraq and invade Afghanistan. Sometimes they're working in small units, working with our partners in Africa, Asia, Latin America, helping them be better.\n","But at the end of the day, they're helping those partners be better at fighting ISIS in North Africa to protect our country so that we don't have to send large numbers of troops.\n","Any other -- someone who knows a Gold Star fallen person.\n","John?\n","Question: General, thank you for being here today and thank you for your service --\n","General Kelly: No, don't -- question, please.\n","Question: -- and for your family's sacrifice.\n","General Kelly: Yeah, first of all, that's a -- you know, we are at the highest level of the U.S. government. The people that will answer those questions will be the people at the other end of the military pyramid.\n","I'm sure the Special Forces group is conducting it. I know they're conducting an investigation. That investigation, of course, under the auspices of AFRICOM, ultimately will go to the White -- go to the Pentagon. I've read the same stories you have. I actually know a lot more than I'm letting on, so -- but I'm not going to tell you.\n","There is an investigation being done. But as I say, the men and women of our country that are serving all around the world -- I mean, what, you know, what the hell is my son doing back in the fight? He's back in the fight because -- working with Iraqi soldiers who are infinitely better than they were a few years ago to take ISIS on directly so that we don't have to do it. Small numbers of Marines where he is -- working alongside those guys. That's why they're out there, whether it's Niger, Iraq, or whatever. We don't want to send tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines, in particular, to go fight.\n","I'll take one more, but it's got to be from someone who knows -- all right.\n","Question: General, when you talk about Niger, sir, what does your intelligence tell you about the Russian connection with them? And the stories that are coming out now, they're supporting --\n","General Kelly: I have no -- no knowledge of any Russian connection, but I was not, in my position, to know that. That's a question for NORTHCOM or for -- not NORTHCOM -- for AFRICOM or DOD.\n","So, thanks very much, everybody.\n","As I walk off the stage, understand there's tens of thousands of American kids, mostly, doing their nation's bidding all around the world. They don't have to be in uniform. You know, when I was a kid, every man in my life was a veteran -- World War II, Korea, and there was the draft. These young people today, they don't do it for any other reason than their selfless -- sense of selfless devotion to this great nation.\n","We don't look down upon those of you who that haven't served. In fact, in a way we're a little bit sorry because you'll have never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kind of things our service men and women do -- not for any other reason than they love this country. So just think of that.\n","And I do appreciate your time.\n","Take care. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," \"Taking Chance\" is a very, very good movie to watch, if you haven't ever seen it. the best 1 percent this country produces is the most young men and women, says john mcdonalds. --------------------------\n","621 \n","Original text: Mr. Chairman and Members of the Notification Committee:\n","I shall, at an early day, and in a more formal manner, accept the nomination which you tender, and shall at that time discuss the various questions covered by the Democratic platform. It may not be out of place, however, to submit a few observations at this time upon the general character of the contest before us and upon the question which is declared to be of paramount importance in this campaign.\n","When I say that the contest of 1900 is a contest of 1900 is a contest between Democracy on the one hand and plutocracy on the other I do not mean to say that all our opponents have deliberately chosen to give to organized wealth a predominating influence in the affairs of the Government, but I do assert that on the important issues of the day the Republican party is dominated by those influences which constantly tend to substitute the worship of mammon for the protection of the rights of man.\n","In 1859 Lincoln said that the Republican Party believed in the man and the dollar, but that in case of conflict it believed in the man before the dollar. This is the proper relation which should exist between the two. Man, the handiwork of God, comes first; money, the handiwork of man, is of inferior importance. Man is the master, money the servant, but upon all important questions today Republican legislation tends to make money the master and man the servant.\n","The maxim of Jefferson, “equal rights to all and special privileges to none,” and the doctrine of Lincoln that this should be a government “of the people, by the people and for the people,” are being disregarded and the instrumentalities of government are being used to advance the interests of those who are in a position to secure favors from the Government.\n","The Democratic party is not making war upon the honest acquisition of wealth; it has no desire to discourage industry, economy, and thrift. On the contrary, it gives to every citizen the greatest possible stimulus to honest toil when it promises him protection in the enjoyment of the proceeds of his labor. Property rights are most secure when human rights are most respected. Democracy strives for civilization in which every member of society will share according to his merits.\n","No one has a right to expect from a society more than a fair compensation for the services No one has a right to expect from a society more than a fair compensation for the services which he renders to society. If he secures more it is at the expense of some one else. It is no injustice to him to prevent his doing injustice to another. To him who would, either through class legislation or in the absence of necessary legislation, trespass upon the rights of another the Democratic party says \"Thou shalt not.\"\n","Against us are arrayed a comparatively small but politically and financially powerful number who really profit by Republican policies; but with them are associated a large number who, because of their attachment to their party name, are giving their support to doctrines antagonistic to the former teachings of their own party.\n","Republicans who used to advocate bimetallism now try to convince themselves that the gold standard is good; Republicans who were formerly attached to the greenback are now seeking an excuse for giving national banks control of the nation's paper money; Republicans who used to boast that the Republican party was paying off the national debt are now looking for reasons to support a perpetual and increasing debt; Republicans who formerly abhorred a trust now beguile themselves with the delusion that there are good trusts, and bad trusts, while in their minds, the line between the two is becoming more and more obscure; Republicans who, in times past, congratulated the country upon the small expense of our standing army, are now making light of the objections which are urged against a large increase in the permanent military establishment; Republicans who gloried in our independence when the nation was less powerful now look with favor upon a foreign alliance; Republicans who three years ago condemned \"forcible annexation\" as immoral and even criminal are now sure that it is both immoral and criminal to oppose forcible annexation. That partisanship has already blinded many to present dangers is certain; how large a portion of the Republican party can be drawn over to the new policies remains to be seen.\n","For a time Republican leaders were inclined to deny to opponents the right to criticize the Philippine policy of the administration, but upon investigation they found that both Lincoln and Clay asserted and exercised the right to criticize a President during the progress of the Mexican war.\n","Instead of meeting the issue boldly and submitting a clear and positive plan for dealing with the Philippine question, the Republican convention adopted a platform the larger part of which was devoted to boasting and self-congratulation.\n","In attempting to press economic questions upon the country to the exclusion of those which involve the very structure of our government, the Republican leaders give new evidence of their abandonment of the earlier ideals of their party and of their complete subservience to pecuniary considerations.\n","But they shall not be permitted to evade the stupendous and far-reaching issue which they have deliberately brought into the arena of politics. When the president, supported by a practically unanimous vote of the House and Senate, entered upon a war with Spain for the purpose of aiding the struggling patriots of Cuba, the country, without regard to party, applauded.\n","Although the Democrats realized that the administration would necessarily gain a political advantage from the conduct of a war which in the very nature of the case must soon end in a complete victory, they vied with the Republicans in the support which they gave to the president. When the war was over and the Republican leaders began to suggest the propriety of a colonial policy opposition at once manifested itself.\n","When the President finally laid before the Senate a treaty which recognized the independence of Cuba, but provided for the cession of the Philippine Islands to the United States, the menace of imperialism became so apparent that many preferred to reject the treaty and risk the ills that might follow rather than take the chance of correcting the errors of the treaty by the independent action of this country.\n","I was among the number of those who believed it better to ratify the treaty and end the war, release the volunteers, remove the excuse for war expenditures and then give the Filipinos the independence which might be forced from Spain by a new treaty.\n","In view of the criticism which my action aroused in some quarters, I take this occasion to restate the reasons given at that time. I thought it safer to trust the American people to give independence to the Filipinos than to trust the accomplishment of that purpose to diplomacy with an unfriendly nation.\n","Lincoln embodied an argument in the question when he asked, \"Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?\" I believe that we are now in a better position to wage a successful contest against imperialism than we would have been had the treaty been rejected. With the treaty ratified a clean-cut issue is presented between a government by consent and a government by force, and imperialists must bear the responsibility for all that happens until the question is settled.\n","If the treaty had been rejected the opponents of imperialism would have been held responsible for any international complications which might have arisen before the ratification of another treaty. But whatever difference of opinion may have existed as to the best method of opposing a colonial policy, there never was any difference as to the great importance of the question and there is no difference now as to the course to be pursued.\n","The title of Spain being extinguished we were at liberty to deal with the Filipinos according to American principles. The Bacon resolution, introduced a month before hostilities broke out at Manila, promised independence to the Filipinos on the same terms that it was promised to the Cubans. I supported this resolution and believe that its adoption prior to the breaking out of hostilities would have prevented bloodshed, and that its adoption at any subsequent time would have ended hostilities.\n","If the treaty had been rejected considerable time would have necessarily elapsed before a new treaty could have been agreed upon and ratified and during that time the question would have been agitating the public mind. If the Bacon resolution had been adopted by the senate and carried out by the president, either at the time of the ratification of the treaty or at any time afterwards, it would have taken the question of imperialism out of politics and left the American people free to deal with their domestic problems. But the resolution was defeated by the vote of the Republican Vice-President, and from that time to this a Republican congress has refused to take any action whatever in the matter.\n","When hostilities broke out at Manila, Republican speakers and Republican editors at once sought to lay the blame upon those who had delayed the ratification of the treaty, and, during the progress of the war, the same Republicans have accused the opponents of imperialism of giving encouragement to the Filipinos. This is a cowardly evasion of responsibility.\n","If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.\n","The Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated to make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, \"Give me liberty or give me death,\" he expressed a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.\n","Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery. Or, if the statute of limitations has run again the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are forgotten.\n","Some one has said that a truth once spoken, can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.\n","Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here.\n","Lincoln said that the safety of this Nation was not in its fleets, its armies, or its forts, but in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere, and he warned his countrymen that they could not destroy this spirit without planting the seeds of despotism at their own doors.\n","Even now we are beginning to see the paralyzing influence if imperialism. Heretofore this Nation has been prompt to express its sympathy with those who were fighting for civil liberty. While our sphere of activity has been limited to the Western Hemisphere, our sympathies have not been bounded by the seas. We have felt it due to ourselves and to the world, as well as to those who were struggling for the right to govern themselves, to proclaim the interest which our people have, from the date of their own independence, felt in every contest between human rights and arbitrary power.\n","Three-quarters of a century ago, when our nation was small, the struggles of Greece aroused our people, and Webster and Clay gave eloquent expression to the universal desire for Grecian independence. In 1896 all parties manifested a lively interest in the success of the Cubans, but now when a war is in progress in South Africa, which must result in the extension of the monarchical idea, or in the triumph of a republic, the advocates of imperialism in this country dare not say a word in behalf of the Boers.\n","Sympathy for the Boers does not arise from any unfriendliness towards England; the American people are not unfriendly toward the people of any nation. This sympathy is due to the fact that, as stated in our platform, we believe in the principles of self-government and reject, as did our forefathers, the claims of monarchy. If this nation surrenders its belief in the universal application of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, it will lose the prestige and influence which it has enjoyed among the nations as an exponent of popular government.\n","Our opponents, conscious of the weakness of their cause, seek to confuse imperialism with expansion, and have even dared to claim Jefferson as a supporter of their policy. Jefferson spoke so freely and used language with such precision that no one can be ignorant of his views. On one occasion he declared: \"If there be one principle more deeply rooted than any other in the mind of every American, it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest.\" And again he said: \"Conquest is not in our principles; it is inconsistent with our government.\"\n","The forcible annexation of territory to be governed by arbitrary power differs as much from the acquisition of territory to be built up into States as a monarchy differs from a democracy. The Democratic party does not oppose expansion when expansion enlarges the area of the Republic and incorporates land which can be settled by American citizens, or adds to our population people who are willing to become citizens and are capable of discharging their duties as such.\n","The acquisition of the Louisiana territory, Florida, Texas and other tracts which have been secured from time to time enlarged the republic and the Constitution followed the flag into the new territory. It is now proposed to seize upon distant territory already more densely populated than our own country and to force upon the people a government for which there is no warrant in our Constitution or our laws.\n","Even the argument that this earth belongs to those who desire to cultivate it and who have the physical power to acquire it cannot be invoked to justify the appropriation of the Philippine Islands by the United States. If the islands were uninhabited American citizens would not be willing to go there and till the soil. The white race will not live so near the equator. Other nations have tried to colonize in the same latitude. The Netherlands have controlled Java for three hundred years and yet today there are less than sixty thousand people of European birth scattered among the twenty-five million natives.\n","After a century and a half of English domination in India, less than one-twentieth of one per cent of the people of India are of English birth, and it requires an army of seventy thousand British soldiers to take care of the tax collectors. Spain had asserted title to the Philippine Islands for three centuries and yet when our fleet entered Manila bay there were less than ten thousand Spaniards residing in the Philippines.\n","A colonial policy means that we shall send to the Philippine Islands a few traders, a few taskmasters and a few office-holders and an army large enough to support the authority of a small fraction of the people while they rule the natives.\n","If we have an imperial policy we must have a great standing army as its natural and necessary complement. The sprit which will justify the forcible annexation of the Philippine Islands will justify the seizure of other islands and the domination of other people, and with wars of conquest we can expect a certain, if not rapid, growth of our military establishment.\n","That a large permanent increase in our regular army is intended by Republican leaders is not a matter of conjecture, but a matter of fact. In his message of December 5,1898, the president asked for authority to increase the standing army to 100,000. In 1896 the army contained about 25,000. Within two years the president asked for four times that many, and a Republican house of representatives complied with the request after the Spanish treaty had been signed, and when no country was at war with the United States.\n","If such an army is demanded when an imperial policy is contemplated, but not openly avowed, what may be expected if the people encourage the Republican party by indorsing its policy at the polls?\n","A large standing army is not only a pecuniary burden to the people and, if accompanied by compulsory service, a constant source of irritation, but it is ever a menace to a Republican form of government.\n","The army is the personification of force, and militarism will inevitably change the ideals of the people and turn the thoughts of our young men from the arts of peace to the science of war. The Government which relies for its defense upon its citizens is more likely to be just than one which has at call a large body of professional soldiers.\n","A small standing army and a well-equipped and well-disciplined state militia are sufficient at ordinary times, and in an emergency the nation should in the future as in the past place its dependence upon the volunteers who come from all occupations at their country's call and return to productive labor when their services are no longer required -- men who fight when the country needs fighters and work when the country needs workers. The Republican platform assumes that the Philippine Islands will be retained under American sovereignty, and we have a right to demand of the Republican leaders a discussion of the future status of the Filipino. Is he to be a citizen or a subject? Are we to bring into the body politic eight or ten million Asiatics so different from us in race and history that amalgamation is impossible? Are they to share with us in making the laws and shaping the destiny of this nation? No Republican of prominence has been bold enough to advocate such a proposition.\n","The McEnery resolution, adopted by the senate immediately after the ratification of the treaty, expressly negatives this idea. The Democratic platform describes the situation when it says that the Filipinos cannot be citizens without endangering our civilization. Who will dispute it? And what is the alternative? If the Filipino is not to be a citizen, shall we make him a subject? On that question the Democratic platform speaks with equal emphasis. It declares that the Filipino cannot be a subject without endangering our form of government. A republic can have no subjects. A subject is possible only in a government resting upon force; he is unknown in a government derived without consent and taxation without representation.\n","The Republican platform says that \"the largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and our duties shall be secured to them (the Filipinos) by law.\" This is a strange doctrine for a government which owes its very existence to the men who offered their lives as a protest against government without consent and taxation without representation. In what respect does the position of the Republican party differ from the position taken by the English Government in 1776? Did not the English Government promise a good government to the colonists? What king ever promised a bad government to his people? Did not the English Government promise that the colonists should have the largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and English duties? Did not the Spanish Government promise to give to the Cubans the largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and Spanish duties? The whole difference between a monarchy and a republic may be summed up in one sentence. In a monarchy the king gives to the people what he believes to be a good government; in a republic the people secure for themselves what they believe to be a good government.\n","The Republican party has accepted the European idea and planted itself upon the ground taken by George III., and by every ruler who distrusts the capacity of the people for self-government or denies them a voice in their own affairs.\n","The Republican platform promises that some measure of self-government is to be given the Filipinos by law; but even this pledge is not fulfilled. Nearly sixteen months elapsed after the ratification of the treaty before the adjournment of congress last June and yet no law was passed dealing with the Philippine situation. The will of the president has been the only law in the Philippine islands wherever the American authority extends. Why does the Republican party hesitate to legislate upon the Philippine question? Because a law would disclose the radical departure from history and precedent contemplated by those who control the Republican party. The storm of protest which greeted the Puerto Rican bill was an indication of what may be expected when the American people are brought face to face with legislation upon this subject.\n","If the Puerto Ricans, who welcomed annexation, are to be denied the guarantees of our Constitution, what is to be the lot of the Filipinos, who resisted our authority? If secret influences could compel a disregard of our plain duty toward friendly people, living near our shores, what treatment will those same influences provide for unfriendly people 7,000 miles away? If, in this country where the people have a right to vote, Republican leaders dare not take the side of the people against the great monopolies which have grown up within the last few years, how can they be trusted to protect the Filipinos from the corporations which are waiting to exploit the islands?\n","Is the sunlight of full citizenship to be enjoyed by the people of the United States, and the twilight of semi-citizenship endured by the people of Puerto Rico, while the thick darkness of perpetual vassalage covers the Philippines? The Puerto Rico tariff law asserts the doctrine that the operation of the constitution is confined to the forty-five states.\n","The Democratic party disputes this doctrine and denounces it as repugnant to both the letter and spirit of our organic law. There is no place in our system of government for the deposit of arbitrary and irresponsible power. That the leaders of a great party should claim for any president or congress the right to treat millions of people as mere \"possessions\" and deal with them unrestrained by the constitution or the bill of rights shows how far we have already departed from the ancient landmarks and indicates what may be expected if this nation deliberately enters upon a career of empire.\n","The territorial form of government is temporary and preparatory, and the chief security a citizen of a territory has is found in the fact that he enjoys the same constitutional guarantees and is subject to the same general laws as the citizen of a state. Take away this security and his rights will be violated and his interests sacrificed at the demand of those who have political influence. This is the evil of the colonial system, no matter by what nation it is applied.\n","What is our title to the Philippine Islands? Do we hold them by treaty or by conquest? Did we buy them or did we take them? Did we purchase the people? If not, how did we secure title to them? Were they thrown in with the land? Will the Republicans say that inanimate earth has value but that when that earth is molded by the divine hand and stamped with the likeness of the Creator it becomes a fixture and passes with the soil? If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, it is impossible to secure title to people, either by force or by purchase. We could extinguish Spain's title by treaty, but if we hold title we must hold it by some method consistent with our ideas of government. When we made allies of the Filipinos and armed them to fight against Spain, we disputed Spain's title. If we buy Spain's title we are not innocent purchasers.\n","There can be no doubt that we accepted and utilized the services of the Filipinos, and that when we did so we had full knowledge that they were fighting for their own independence, and I submit that history furnishes no example of turpitude baser than ours if we now substitute our yoke for the Spanish yoke.\n","Let us consider briefly the reasons which have been given in support of an imperialistic policy. Some say that it is our duty to hold the Philippine Islands. But duty is not an argument; it is a conclusion. To ascertain what our duty is, in any emergency, we must apply well settled and generally accepted principles. It is our duty to avoid stealing, no matter whether the thing to be stolen is of great or little value. It is our duty to avoid killing a human being, no matter where the human being lives or to what race or class he belongs.\n","Every one recognizes the obligation imposed upon individuals to observe both the human and the moral law, but as some deny the application of those laws to nations, it may not be out of place to quote the opinions of others. Jefferson, than whom there is no higher political authority, said: \"I know of but one code of morality for men, whether acting singly or collectively.\"\n","Franklin, whose learning, wisdom and virtue are a part of the priceless legacy bequeathed to use from the revolutionary days, expressed the same idea in even stronger language when he said:\n","Justice is strictly due between neighbor nations as between neighbor citizens. A highwayman is as much a robber when he plunders in a gang as when single; and the nation that makes an unjust war is only a great gang.\n","Many may dare to do in crowds what they would not dare to do as individuals, but the moral character of an act is not determined by the number of those who join it. Force can defend a right, but force has never yet created a right. If it was true, as declared in the resolutions of intervention, that the Cubans \"are and of right ought to be free and independent\" (language taken from the Declaration of Independence), it is equally true that the Filipinos \"are and of right ought to be free and independent.\"\n","The right of the Cubans to freedom was not based upon their proximity to the United States, nor upon the language which they spoke, nor yet upon the race or races to which they belonged. Congress by a practically unanimous vote declared that the principles enunciated at Philadelphia in 1776 were still alive and applicable to the Cubans. Who will draw a line between the natural rights of the Cubans and the Filipinos? Who will say that the former has a right to liberty and that the latter has no rights which we are bound to respect? And, if the Filipinos \"are and of right ought to be free and independent,\" what right have we to force our government upon them without their consent? Before our duty can be ascertained their rights must be determined, and when their rights are once determined it is as much our duty to respect those rights as it was the duty of Spain to respect the rights of the people of Cuba or the duty of England to respect the rights of the American colonists. Rights never conflict; duties never clash. Can it be our duty to usurp political rights which belong to others? Can it be our duty to kill those who, following the example of our forefathers, love liberty well enough to fight for it?\n","A poet has described the terror which overcame a soldier who in the midst of the battle discovered that he had slain his brother. It is written \"All ye are brethren.\" Let us hope for the coming day when human life -- which when once destroyed cannot be restored -- will be so sacred that it will never be taken except when necessary to punish a crime already committed, or to prevent a crime about to be committed.\n","It is said that we have assumed before the world obligations which make it necessary for us to permanently maintain a government in the Philippine Islands. I reply first, that the highest obligation of this nation is to be true to itself. No obligation to any particular nations, or to all the nations combined, can require the abandonment of our theory of government, and the substitution of doctrines against which our whole national life has been a protest. And, second, that our obligation to the Filipinos, who inhabit the islands, is greater than any obligation which we can owe to foreigners who have a temporary residence in the Philippines or desire to trade there.\n","It is argued by some that the Filipinos are incapable of self-government and that, therefore, we owe it to the world to take control of them. Admiral Dewey, in an official report to the Navy Department, declared the Filipinos more capable of self-government than the Cubans and said that he based his opinion upon a knowledge of both races. But I will not rest the case upon the relative advancement of the Filipinos. Henry Clay, in defending the right of the people of South America to self-government said:\n","It is the doctrine of thrones that man is too ignorant to govern himself. Their partisans assert his incapacity in reference to all nations; if they cannot command universal assent to the proposition, it is then demanded to particular nations; and our pride and our presumption too often make converts of us. I contend that it is to arraign the disposition of Providence himself to suppose that he has created beings incapable of governing themselves, and to be trampled on by kings. Self-government is the natural government of man.\n","Clay was right. There are degrees of proficiency in the art of self-government, but it is a reflection upon the Creator to say that he denied to any people the capacity for self-government. Once admit that some people are capable of self-government and that others are not and that the capable people have a right to seize upon and govern the incapable, and you make force -- brute force -- the only foundation of government and invite the reign of a despot. I am not willing to believe that an all-wise and an all-loving God created the Filipinos and then left them thousands of years helpless until the islands attracted the attention of European nations.\n","Republicans ask, \"Shall we haul down the flag that floats over our dead in the Philippines?\" The same question might have been asked, when the American flag floated over Chapultepec and waved over the dead who fell there; but the tourist who visits the City of Mexico finds there a national cemetery owned by the United States and cared for by an American citizen. Our flag still floats over our dead, but when the treaty with Mexico was signed American authority withdrew to the Rio Grande, and I venture the opinion that during the last fifty years the people of Mexico have made more progress under the stimulus of independence and self-government than they would have made under a carpet-bag government held in place by bayonets. The United States and Mexico, friendly republics, are each stronger and happier than they would have been had the former been cursed and the latter crushed by an imperialistic policy disguised as \"benevolent assimilation.\"\n","“Can we not govern colonies?” we are asked. The question is not what we can do, but what we ought to do. This nation can do whatever it desires to do, but it must accept responsibility for what it does. If the Constitution stands in the way, the people can amend the Constitution. I repeat, the nation can do whatever it desires to do, but it cannot avoid the natural and legitimate results of it own conduct.\n","The young man upon reaching his majority can do what he pleases. He can disregard the teachings of his parents; he can trample upon all that he has been taught to consider sacred; he can disobey the laws of the State, the laws of society and the laws of God. He can stamp failure upon his life and make his very existence a curse to his fellow men, and he can bring his father and mother in sorrow to the grave; but he cannot annul the sentence, “The wages of sin is death.”\n","And so with the nation. It is of age and it can do what it pleases; it can spurn the traditions of the past; it can repudiate the principles upon which the nation rests; it can employ force instead of reason; it can substitute might for right; it can conquer weaker people; it can exploit their lands, appropriate their property and kill their people; but it cannot repeal the moral law or escape the punishment decreed for the violation of human rights.\n","Would we tread in the paths of tyranny,\n","Nor reckon the tyrant's cost?\n","Who taketh another's liberty\n","His freedom is also lost.\n","Would we win as the strong have ever won,\n","Make ready to pay the debt,\n","For the God who reigned over Babylon\n","Is the God who is reigning yet.\n","Some argue that American rule in the Philippine Islands will result in the better education of the Filipinos. Be not deceived. If we expect to maintain a colonial policy, we shall not find it to our advantage to educate the people. The educated Filipinos are now in revolt against us, and the most ignorant ones have made the least resistance to our domination. If we are to govern them without their consent and give them no voice in determining the taxes which they must pay, we dare not educate them, lest they learn to read the Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the United States and mock us for our inconsistency.\n","The principal arguments, however, advanced by those who enter upon a defense of imperialism are:\n","First -- That we must improve the present opportunity to become a world power and enter into international politics.\n","Second -- That our commercial interests in the Philippine Islands and in the Orient make it necessary for us to hold the islands permanently.\n","Third -- That the spread of the Christian religion will be facilitated by a colonial policy.\n","Fourth -- That there is no honorable retreat from the position which the nation has taken.\n","The first argument is addressed to the nation’s pride and the second to the nation’s pocket-book. The third is intended for the church member and the fourth for the partisan.\n","It is sufficient answer to the first argument to say that for more than a century this nation has been a world power. For ten decades it has been the most potent influence in the world. Not only has it been a world power, but it has done more to shape the politics of the human race than all the other nations of the world combined. Because our Declaration of Independence was promulgated others have been promulgated. Because the patriots of 1776 fought for liberty other have fought for it. Because our Constitution was adopted other constitutions have been adopted.\n","The growth of the principle of self-government, planted on American soil, has been the overshadowing political fact of the nineteenth century. It has made this nation conspicuous among the nations and given it a place in history such as no other nation has ever enjoyed. Nothing has been able to check the onward march of this idea. I am not willing that this nation shall cast aside the omnipotent weapon of truth to seize again the weapons of physical warfare. I would not exchange the glory of this Republic for the glory of all empires that have risen and fallen since time began.\n","The permanent chairman of the last Republican Nation Convention presented the pecuniary argument in all its baldness when he said:\n","We make no hypocritical pretense of being interested in the Philippines solely on account of others. While we regard the welfare of those people as a sacred trust, we regard the welfare of American people first. We see our duty to ourselves as well as to others. We believe in trade expansion. By every legitimate means within the province of government and constitution we mean to stimulate the expansion of our trade and open new markets.\n","This is the commercial argument. It is based upon the theory that war can be rightly waged for pecuniary advantage, and that it is profitable to purchase trade by force and violence. Franklin denied both of these propositions. When Lord Howe asserted that the acts of Parliament which brought on the Revolution were necessary to prevent American trade from passing into foreign channels, Franklin replied:\n","To me it seems that neither the obtaining nor retaining of any trade, howsoever valuable, is an object for which men may justly spill each other's blood; that the true and sure means of extending and securing commerce are the goodness and cheapness of commodities, and that the profits of no trade can ever be equal to the expense of compelling it and holding it by fleets and armies. I consider this war against us, therefore, as both unjust and unwise.\n","I place the philosophy of Franklin against the sordid doctrine of those who would put a price upon the head of an American soldier and justify a war of conquest upon the ground that it will pay. The democratic party is in favor of the expansion of trade. It would extend our trade by every legitimate and peaceful means; but it is not willing to make merchandise of human blood.\n","But a war of conquest is as unwise as it is unrighteous. A harbor and coaling station in the Philippines would answer every trade and military necessity and such a concession could have been secured at any time without difficulty.\n","It is not necessary to own people in order to trade with them. We carry on trade today with every part of the world, and our commerce has expanded more rapidly than the commerce of any European empire. We do not own Japan or China, but we trade with their people. We have not absorbed the republics of Central and South America, but we trade with them. It has not been necessary to have any political connection with Canada or the nations of Europe in order to trade with them. Trade cannot be permanently profitable unless it is voluntary.\n","When trade is secured by force, the cost of securing it and retaining it must be taken out of the profits and the profits are never large enough to cover the expense. Such a system would never be defended but for the fact that the expense is borne by all the people, while the profits are enjoyed by a few.\n","Imperialism would be profitable to the army contractors; it would be profitable to the ship owners, who would carry live soldiers to the Philippines and bring dead soldiers back; it would be profitable to those who would seize upon the franchises, and it would be profitable to the officials whose salaries would be fixed here and paid over there; but to the farmer, to the laboring man and to the vast majority of those engaged in other occupations it would bring expenditure without return and risk without reward.\n","Farmers and laboring men have, as a rule, small incomes and under systems which place the tax upon consumption pay much more than their fair share of the expenses of government. Thus the very people who receive least benefit from imperialism will be injured most by the military burdens which accompany it.\n","In addition to the evils which he and the farmer share in common, the laboring man will be the first to suffer if oriental subjects seek work in the United States; the first to suffer if American capital leaves our shores to employ oriental labor in the Philippines to supply the trade of China and Japan; the first to suffer from the violence which the military spirit arouses and the first to suffer when the methods of imperialism are applied to our own government.\n","It is not strange, therefore, that the labor organizations have been quick to note the approach of these dangers and prompt to protest against both militarism and imperialism.\n","The pecuniary argument, the more effective with certain classes, is not likely to be used so often or presented with so much enthusiasm as the religious argument. If what has been termed the “gunpowder gospel” were urged against the Filipinos only it would be a sufficient answer to say that a majority of the Filipinos are now members of one branch of the Christian church; but the principle involved is one of much wider application and challenges serious consideration.\n","The religious argument varies in positiveness from a passive belief that Providence delivered the Filipinos into our hands, for their good and our glory, to the exultation of the minister who said that we ought to “thrash the natives (Filipinos) until they understand who we are,” and that “every bullet sent, every cannon shot and every flag waved means righteousness.”\n","We cannot approve of this doctrine in one place unless we are willing to apply it everywhere. If there is poison in the blood of the hand it will ultimately reach the heat. It is equally true that forcible Christianity, if planted under the American flag in the far-away Orient, will sooner or later be transplanted upon American soil.\n","If true Christianity consists in carrying out in our daily lives the teachings of Christ, who will say that we are commanded to civilize with dynamite and proselyte with the sword? He who would declare the divine will must prove his authority either by Holy Writ or by evidence of a special dispensation.\n","Imperialism finds no warrant in the Bible. The command, “Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,” has no Gatling gun attachment. When Jesus visited a village of Samaria and the people refused to receive him, some of the disciples suggested that fire should be called down from Heaven to avenge the insult; but the Master rebuked them and said: “Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of; for the Son of Man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” Suppose he had said: “We will thrash them until they understand who we are,” how different would have been the history of Christianity! Compare, if you will, the swaggering, bullying, brutal doctrine of imperialism with the golden rule and the commandment, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”\n","Love not force, was the weapon of the Nazarene; sacrifice for others, not the exploitation of them, was His method of reaching the human heart. A missionary recently told me that the Stars and Stripes once saved his life because his assailant recognized our flag as a flag that had no blood upon it.\n","Let it be known that our missionaries are seeking souls instead of sovereignty; let be it known that instead of being the advance guard of conquering armies, they are going forth to help and uplift, having their loins girt about with the truth and their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, wearing the breastplate of righteousness and carrying the sword of the spirit; let it be known that they are citizens of a nation which respects the rights of the citizens of other nations as carefully as it protects the rights of its own citizens, and the welcome given to our missionaries will be more cordial than the welcome extended to the missionaries of any other nation.\n","The argument made by some that it was unfortunate for the nation that it had anything to do with the Philippine Islands, but that the naval victory at Manila made the permanent acquisition of those islands necessary, is also unsound. We won a naval victory at Santiago, but that did not compel us to hold Cuba.\n","The shedding of American blood in the Philippine Islands does not make it imperative that we should retain possession forever; American blood was shed at San Juan and El Caney, and yet the President has promised the Cubans independence. The fact that the American flag floats over Manila does not compel us to exercise perpetual sovereignty over the islands; the American flag floats over Havana to-day, but the President has promised to haul it down when the flag of the Cuban Republic is ready to rise in its place. Better a thousand times that our flag in the Orient give way to a flag representing the idea of self-government than that the flag of this Republic should become the flag of an empire.\n","There is an easy, honest, honorable solution of the Philippine question. It is set forth in the Democratic platform and it is submitted with confidence to the American people. This plan I unreservedly indorse. If elected, I will convene Congress in extraordinary session as soon as inaugurated and recommend an immediate declaration of the nation’s purpose, first, to establish a stable form of government in the Philippine Islands, just as we are now establishing a stable form of government in Cuba; second, to give independence to the Filipinos as we have promised to give independence to the Cubans; third, to protect the Filipinos from outside interference while they work out their destiny, just as we have protected the republics of Central and South America, and are, by the Monroe doctrine, pledged to protect Cuba.\n","A European protectorate often results in the plundering of the ward by the guardian. An American protectorate gives to the nation protected the advantage of our strength, without making it he victim of our greed. For three-quarters of a century the Monroe doctrine has been a shield to neighboring republics and yet it has imposed no pecuniary burden upon us. After the Filipinos had aided us in the war against Spain, we could not leave them to be the victims of the ambitious designs of European nations, and since we do not desire to make them a part of us or to hold them as subjects, we propose the only alternative, namely, to give them independence and guard them against molestation from without.\n","When our opponents are unable to defend their position by argument they fall back upon the assertion that is destiny, and insist that we must submit to it, no matter how much it violates our moral percepts and our principles of government. This is a complacent philosophy. It obliterates the distinction between right and wrong and makes individuals and nations the helpless victims of circumstance.\n","Destiny is the subterfuge of the invertebrate, who, lacking the courage to oppose error, seeks some plausible excuse for supporting it. Washington said that the destiny of the Republican form of government was deeply, if not finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the American people. How different Washington’s definition of destiny from the Republican definition!\n","The Republicans say that this nation is in the hands of destiny; Washington believed that not only the destiny of our own nation but the destiny of the Republican form of government throughout the world was entrusted to American hands. Immeasurable responsibility! The destiny of this Republic is in the hands of its own people, and upon the success of the experiment here rests the hope of humanity. No exterior force can disturb this Republic, and no foreign influence should be permitted to change its course. What the future has in store for this nation no one has authority to declare, but each individual has his own idea of the nation’s mission, and he owes it to his country as well as to himself to contribute as best he may to the fulfillment of that mission.\n","Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee: I can never fully discharge the debt of gratitude which I owe to my countrymen for the honors which they have so generously bestowed upon me; but, sirs, whether it be my lot to occupy the high office for which the convention has named me, or to spend the remainder of my days in private life, it shall be my constant ambition and my controlling purpose to aid in realizing the high ideals of those whose wisdom and courage and sacrifices brought the Republic into existence.\n","I can conceive of a national destiny surpassing the glories of the present and the past -- a destiny which meets the responsibility of today and measures up to the possibilities of the future. Behold a republic, resting securely upon the foundation stones quarried by revolutionary patriots from the mountain of eternal truth -- a republic applying in practice and proclaiming to the world the self-evident propositions that all men are created equal; that they are endowed with inalienable rights; that governments are instituted among men to secure these rights, and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Behold a republic in which civil and religion liberty stimulate all to earnest endeavor and in which the law restrains every hand uplifted for a neighbor's injury -- a republic in which every citizen is a sovereign, but in which no one cares to wear a crown. Behold a republic standing erect while empires all around are bowed beneath the weight of their own armaments -- a republic whose flag is loved while other flags are only feared. Behold a republic increasing in population, in wealth, in strength and in influence, solving the problems of civilization and hastening the coming of an universal brotherhood -- a republic which shakes thrones and dissolves aristocracies by its silent example and gives light and inspiration to those who sit in darkness. Behold a republic gradually but surely becoming the supreme moral factor in the world's progress and the accepted arbiter of the world's disputes -- a republic whose history, like the path of the just, \"is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\" \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the democratic party is not making war upon the honest acquisition of wealth. it has no desire to discourage industry, economy, and thrift, but it gives to every citizen the greatest stimulus to honest toil when it promises him protection in the enjoyment of the proceeds of his labor. --------------------------\n","622 \n","Original text: MR. BUTLER: I'd like to thank Andrew and LexisNexis and the National Press Club for hosting this event and doing the difficult work of organizing it.\n","When Andrew suggested this a couple of months ago now, I think it was, he told me there was a hunger for discussion in our community, in our professional community, about open source intelligence, and he reminded me of the conference we had -- three-day conference back in 2008. And I thought, yeah, there might be a hunger for it, and I was surprised actually when I saw that he had to cut off registration for the event today.\n","And I appreciate the great turnout, and it’s kind of like a reunion. I’m seeing a lot of really terrific people, people that were pioneers in this business, people like Peggy Lyons [ph], who actually wrote the first Intelligence Community Directive 301 on the National Open Source Enterprise; Dr. Dick Ward from the University of New Haven, who is truly a pioneer in the academic community in terms of bringing open source exploitation capability to the forefront. And I saw that firsthand when he was the dean at Sam Houston University. So really, this is a pleasure for me to be able to see so many good friends and colleagues.\n","I want to thank my panelists, my colleagues, who have taken time out of a very busy schedule to join us here today. Alex Joel is jumping on a plane as soon as we finish up here and going off to speak somewhere else. Ken Rapuano came rushing up 95 to be here to join us today. Doug Magoffin was probably just lingering in the hallway somewhere most of the morning.\n","DOUG MAGOFFIN: Watching soap operas.\n","BUTLER: But we really were fortunate to get people like Kevin O’Connell and Mark Gabriele, who can tell us a lot about what we should be anticipating in the future for open source intelligence.\n","I want to thank all of you for coming. I know you all are very busy, and I know from knowing many of you that you are critical to the overall enterprise, what I consider not the intelligence community but the community of intelligence that we in the IC need to tap into to be able to do our job most effectively.\n","Let me start by just saying that -- telling you a little bit about my small office. Peggy has heard this a few times. My small office was established by our first Director of National Intelligence, Ambassador John Negroponte during the first year of the ODNI, and we were charged with advocacy, integration, evaluation, oversight and guiding strategic investment in our National Open Source Enterprise.\n","And I’m reading this to you out of the first Intelligence Community Directive 300, that actually outlined responsibilities within the DNI, within the Directorate of Collection, for various disciplines that we needed to provide oversight for for the entire community.\n","Now, I’m also charged with encouraging community collaboration, building public-private partnerships, overseeing the DNI Open Source Center and two other national centers. In my advocacy role, I’m a big believer in public discourse about our profession, within the bounds of discretion of course, and believe we have a responsibility to think strategically about our future intelligence community enterprise.\n","I’m proud of the dedicated men and women who have built and sustained our nation’s open source exploitation capabilities. They are extraordinary professionals. They include librarians like Janet Burke [ph], who is sitting here on the second row, the librarian up at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. I’ve watched Janet play a leading role in building our National Open Source Enterprise for the intelligence community.\n","Events like this one allow us to contemplate how the future open source environment might present us with new challenges and new opportunities -- opportunities to do our job better, more efficiently, and honoring our pledge to safeguard our national security and protect and defend our Constitution and our values.\n","My job this afternoon is to provide some foundation and some context for you and the exceptional panelists that have joined us today. We’re here to think towards the future, 10 years hence. Now, I’ve always found that it’s good, if we’re going to have a panel and discuss something like OSINT, that we should define right from the outset what we’re talking about. So let me offer to you the official definition of OSINT, at least the official IC definition.\n","Open source intelligence is:\n","...intelligence produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement.\n","That comes from the Intelligence Community Directive 301 entitled \"National Open Source Enterprise.\" And we didn’t make it up. It was cribbed, actually, from law -- the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2006.\n","\"Open sources\" is kind of a term that’s in vogue. I would say it’s in vogue today because we were trying to think of a better way to capture what we’re doing today as opposed to what we’ve done for decades, because really we’re not doing anything much different than we did during World War II or during the Cold War.\n","Open source is research. It’s good research. It’s rigorous and disciplined research. And I could give you a lot of good examples of how our intelligence community back in the 1940s and 1950s was built on a very solid foundation of what today we call open source intelligence, or open source exploitation. Back then we called it research. We went to librarians to get us the information and to help us find the answers we needed in order to perform our job.\n","What I would rather do is focus in on the game changer. The game changer was the Internet. We are in the Internet age. Today, in 2010, we’re grappling with a capability that is a tremendous force for good, as we have all experienced, I’m sure, and it can be used against us. It can be used against our national security. It can be used against our families. So it’s a typical double-edged sword, a tool that can be used for good or for evil, and it’s a tool that we have to figure out how to exploit best. The Internet has transformed the open source universe.\n","So what’s the ODNI interest in open source exploitation today and looking toward the future? Well, I would like to talk about our imperatives. I think it’s important to look back at, even just five years later, why we are here, or why I’m here at least and why my panelists are engaged in this effort with us in trying to develop a federated National Open Source Enterprise.\n","The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, in Section 1052, states that,\n","It is the sense of Congress that open source intelligence is a valuable source that must be integrated into the intelligence cycle to ensure that United States policymakers are fully and completely informed. The DNI shall ensure that the intelligence community makes efficient and effective use of open source information and analysis.\n","That charge doesn’t come much more directly or strongly, I think, than was provided by Congress and that sense of Congress.\n","The WMD Commission reported out in 2005 in the wake of the 9/11 disaster, and they looked at open source. And one of the things that they gave and provided to us as our mandate, as our charge and as our imperative was that we needed to do more with open source.\n","The WMD Commission stated,\n","Increasingly, intelligence community professionals need to quickly assimilate social, economic and cultural information about a country, information often detailed in open sources.\n","Executive Order 12333 as amended states,\n","All reasonable and lawful means must be used to ensure that the United States will receive the best intelligence possible. All means consistent with applicable federal law in this order and with full consideration of the rights of United States persons shall be used to obtain reliable intelligence information to protect the United States and its interests.\n","Special emphasis shall be given to the production of timely, accurate and insightful reports responsive to decision-makers in the executive branch that draw upon all appropriate sources of information, including open source information.\n","So these are our imperatives today. We’re charged with ensuring that we make the best use of a vast and growing repository of open sources, and the Internet has dramatically changed the availability of open sources to the intelligence community.\n","Looking to the future -- that’s what we’re here to do today. We want to try to look forward 10 years into 2020 and try to figure out, try to grapple with and deliberate on, what might the open source universe look like in 10 years and what might we, as the intelligence community, need to be thinking about? How might we partner with our important partners in the private sector, in academia, foreign partners?\n","The WMD Commission actually projected ahead what they expected to see if we as an intelligence community did our job and did it well. According to the WMD Commission, it is our hope that open source will become an integral part of all intelligence activities.\n","The WMD Commission also referred to a finding and a recommendation where they recommended that about 50 open source analysts -- they called them \"evange-analysts\" [ph] -- be dedicated to the task of going out into the intelligence community and spreading the gospel, so to speak, of open source and the power of open source.\n","But the WMD Commission wasn’t thinking in static terms. The WMD Commission said, however, we have an expectation:\n","We expect that the need for these specialized analysts will not be permanent. Over time, the knowledge this group has about open sources is likely to be absorbed by the general population of analysts as a result both of their education outreach efforts and of the influx of younger, more technologically savvy analysts. As this happens, these open source specialists can be absorbed into the broader analytic corps.\n","Now, it’s important to understand this charge or this expectation from the WMD Commission. For those of us in this business who are responsible for ensuring that the IC makes appropriate and best use of open sources, we have been tasked by the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission essentially with putting ourselves out of business -- out of the business of establishing, nurturing, governing an industrial area capability for delivering open source-derived intelligence to decision-makers. The WMD Commission’s underlying message is that open source exploitation skills should be a core competency of every intelligence professional.\n","If we do our job well, we should see the U.S. intelligence community in 2020 exploiting, in a disciplined, ubiquitous fashion, the vast, pervasive and persistent cloud of open sources of information that the Internet and other technologies are now making accessible and conceivable. Our efficient and robust just-in-time access to expertise, knowledge and open source-derived wisdom should improve to the point that we can truly focus more acutely on the most difficult intelligence challenges facing our nation using other means, more expensive means, more esoteric, other-than-open-source means of collection.\n","I think there are several factors that we need to think about as we look to 2020. The first is obviously going to be technology. We have already seen that the Internet is a game-changer and we are going to see, riding on the backbone of the Internet, more game-changers, and I think Mark Gabriele will talk -- or speculate about what some of those game-changers might look like.\n","Smartphones. It’s astonishing today what a smartphone is capable of and what that provides to anybody with access to a smartphone, and what it provides to people that can get that material that people that have a smartphone can access.\n","GPS devices. Some of you, like my wife and I today, probably used a GPS device to get here. The GPS device in our vehicle -- the Garmin, the Magellan, the TomTom -- that is a tool that’s empowered by open source data, NAVTEQ data, and that’s a great example of the blending of technology and open source data in an interface that provides very actionable, timely, instantaneous intelligence.\n","Dr. Mark Gabriele will offer some insights into what we could be facing in the next 10 years and what those open source intelligence technologies could mean to our national security.\n","The second item I think we need to talk about are resources and risk. We should anticipate that our ability as a nation to fund ever-increasing growth in intelligence community budgets will end. What might that mean to our intelligence community, to our effort to exploit open sources? What about the relative capabilities of our adversaries? How might actual risk and the U.S. public’s tolerance of risk change in the ensuing 10 years?\n","Ironically, despite our immense national wealth and unprecedented investment in intelligence community capability, one could argue that our comparative advantage as an intelligence powerhouse has eroded in recent years with the advent of the Internet and the astonishing access to data it affords to everyone -- to your children, to our adversaries. The poor man’s intelligence community is now available to anyone with access to an Internet café or a smartphone.\n","Our relative expertise and ability to exploit open sources is one advantage we would be well-advised to ensure we never cede to our adversaries. We must stay at the forefront of open source exploitation, innovation and sophistication.\n","What if budgets do fall? It’s a trite but powerful aphorism that necessity is the mother of invention. My team recently examined what the future could look like if we were forced to deal with drastic budget reductions in the intelligence community.\n","We took an extreme case and simulated a much smaller nation. We used an actual nation, that I hesitate to name, with a much smaller intelligence budget to postulate and assess how the U.S. intelligence community might actually end up relying more on inexpensive, virtually free open source information to address many of our intelligence requirements.\n","Panelists today with extensive experience dealing with outsized challenges and constrained resources are two former Marines, Doug Magoffin and Ken Rapuano, can address how falling resources, changes to our comparative advantage over adversaries, our adversaries’ growing sophistication and access to open source intelligence, and U.S. society’s tolerance of risk and intrusion into our privacy can affect how we might use or might refrain from using open source technologies in the future.\n","Third, civil liberties and privacy -- key issues that we need to think about in the next 10 years. Foreseeable and unforeseen advances in technology, fluctuating resources and adjusting comparative advantages enjoyed by our adversaries will have significant ramifications for our society, for our security, for our civil liberties and for our privacy.\n","Again, Ken Rapuano, enjoying the perspective of somebody with direct and intense involvement in our homeland security policymaking after September 11th, 2001, can discuss the tensions in delicate and shifting policymaking and political balance we must find between security and privacy. And he can speak to how that balance changes with events, the actions of our adversaries, and other factors beyond our control.\n","Our community’s leading expert on civil liberties and privacy and what we as intelligence professionals must consider as we try to carry out our responsibilities is our statutory ODNI civil liberties protection officer, Mr. Alex Joel. Mr. Joel can speak to potential impact of pervasive Internet access to information about U.S. persons and how we must consider how and when we can, should, or should not exploit new technologies.\n","Finally, a fourth issue that I think we have to grapple with is how we organize and prioritize today to make most efficient use of open sources in the next 10 years. In my view, this is our real challenge. It’s something we as U.S. intelligence professionals, intelligence community leaders, U.S. industry and potential partners, partners in academia, must collectively tackle.\n","If we aspire to make disciplined, rigorous and sophisticated use of open source exploitation; if we intend to make that a core competency of every intelligence community professional, what might that require? How will dramatic technological shifts affect our ability to get to that stage? Will our national demographics, as the WMD Commission suggest, help us achieve our goals, or will we need to do more to exploit our demographic advantages? Do we, in fact, enjoy relative demographic advantage or will other nations enjoy those comparative advantages and outstrip us in sophisticated use of the Internet as an intelligence engine?\n","With growing access to open source data and new tools and applications that can sift and mash up that data for relevance and timely action, how much, if any, of the open source intelligence exploitation industry will be the exclusive province of the U.S. government, and how much will we be borrowing or buying just-in-time, and possibly at dramatically lower costs, over the next decade? Mr. Kevin O’Connell and our entire panel can help us delve into aspects of these and other key questions as we contemplate OSINT in the year 2020.\n","Thank you for joining us today. I look forward to your questions, your insights and a constructive dialogue on these issues. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," mr. BUTLER: i appreciate the great turnout, and it’s kind of like a reunion. he says the IC needs to tap into to be able to do our job most effectively, not just the intelligence community, but the community of intelligence that we in the world need to tinker with if we can do the job best. --------------------------\n","623 \n","Original text: Beloved friends, I'm actually only here to give you a change of accents; I just hope you don't need simultaneous translation. But I'm here as part of an English delegation to give you the view from Europe. And the view from Europe is that AIPAC is something out of this world. It is just amazing.\n","Friends, it reminds me -- if I can just give you this story -- lovely story about Yossi, an Israeli, who opened a falafel bar in Golders Green. You know, the Golders Green is the English Brooklyn. And Yossi's falafel bar was one day visited by the tax inspector who was reading through his books and he was saying:\n","\"Mr. Yossi, this falafel of yours, this is a kind of Jewish takeaway -- am I right?\"\n","And Yossi, with a big smile, says, \"Yes.\"\n","The tax inspector says, \"Mr. Yossi, I understand where you've written down as expenses rent, electricity, materials; but why have you written down under \"Business Expenses\" two trips to Miami and three trips to Tel Aviv?\"\n","And Yossi, with a big smile, said, \"That's easy; we deliver!\"\n","Friends, AIPAC, you deliver. You deliver a strong Israel and a strong Jewish people. May God bless you and may you continue to bless the people in the state of Israel.\n","Friends, I want to tell you how things are looking like in Europe today. When I was a child, there was one line in the Haggadah that I never understood. [Delivered in Hebrew.] \"It was not one alone who stood against us.\" [Delivered in Hebrew.] \"But in every generation they did so.\" And always as a child I used to say, that belongs to my parents' generation, not to us -- not to us born after the Holocaust. I grew up -- in all my life I never experienced a single incident of anti-Semitism -- until 11 years ago.\n","Eleven years ago, our youngest daughter, who was studying at a British university, came home in tears. She had been at an anti-globalization rally which quickly turned into a tirade -- first against America, then against Israel, then against Jews. And with tears in her eyes she said, \"Dad, they hate us.\" That is a terrible situation, but it's reality in Europe today.\n","I have to tell you that what we grew up with, \"never again,\" is beginning to sound like \"ever again.\" And at the heart of it is hostility to Israel. Of course, not all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. But make no mistake what has happened. In the Middle Ages Jews were hated because of their religion. In the 19th century and the 20th, they were hated because of their race. Today, when it's no longer done to hate people for their religion or their race -- today they are hated because of their State. The reason changes, but the hate stays the same. Anti-Zionism is the new anti-Semitism.\n","And friends, I've come here to tell you that I believe the example of AIPAC must now inform Jewish communities around Europe, because we have to stand up and fight, and we have to stand up and win. Friends, anti-Zionism is today rife throughout the world. All our students on campuses know about it. And what is our crime? What is Israel's crime? It's that we have chutzpah. Let me tell you the chutzpah we have. After all, there are 56 Islamic states. There are 125 nations whose majority is Christian. And now Jews want a State of their own. How dare they? And it's so big.\n","Friends, you know how big Israel is? There's a lovely park in a little corner of South Africa. I don't know if you've ever been there. It's a sort of wild game reserve where you can see lions and giraffes and elephants and hippopotamuses -- or hippopotami, depending on whether or not they've had a classical education. It is called the Kruger National Park.\n","Friends, Israel is the same size as Kruger National Park. How dare they want something that big? Don't Jews by now know that their role in history is to be scattered, dispersed, homeless, and defenseless? And now they want a space where they can defend themselves. How dare they? Friends, we dare because we are human. We dare because to be denied the right to self-defense is to be treated as less than human. Mr. Erdogan, it is anti-Zionism that is a crime against humanity.\n","How -- How much longer -- How much longer must the Jewish people have to fight for the right to be? Let me tell you, friends, what is Israel. Elaine and I have just come back; just 10 days ago we were on a series of missions in Israel. And let us remind you what we saw, what you saw, what everyone sees -- but the world does not see.\n","We saw school after school and youth village after youth village where children at-risk or children from dysfunctional or abusive families are taken and given the care that will give them hope and a future in life.\n","We saw youth villages where Ethiopian children are given the means, suddenly, to make that leap across centuries and cultures and find their own excellence. We saw the power of love to transform lives.\n","We saw hospitals. I don't know if you've been recently to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa. In Haifa, the Rambam Hospital is building the world's largest underground hospital -- proof against bombs, missiles, chemical and biological weapons, so that when Israel's enemies decide to destroy lives, they will continue saving them.\n","We saw the new Bar-Ilan Medical Center in Safed, set up to bring the finest possible medical treatment. Who to? Only to Jews? No. To Muslims, to Christians, to Druze villages throughout the Galil, because to be a Jew in Israel means you care for every life; every life is sacred.\n","We saw the Laniado Hospital in the Netanya, a place I always visit because it moves me almost beyond words. Many of you know the Laniado Hospital was built by the Klausenburger Rebbe, a survivor of Auschwitz who during the Holocaust lost his wife and all 11 children. And there in the camps of death made an oath that if he should ever survive he would dedicate the rest of his life to saving life.\n","That is what I see in Israel. Every time I visit Israel I find among Israelis, secular or religious, an absolute unswerving dedication to Moshe Rabbenu's gate -- great command Uvacharta Bachayim, \"Choose life.\" Israel is the sustained defiance of hatred and power in the name of life because we are the people who sanctify life.\n","Friends, in the last decade the equation has changed. Today, the struggle against Israel is no longer just against Israel. Today what is at stake in Israel's survival is the future of freedom itself. Because make no mistake, this will be the defining battle of the 21st century. Which will prevail? The will to power with its violence, terror, missiles, and bombs? Or, or the will to life with its hospitals, schools, freedoms, and rights? Believe you me, I have the privilege of knowing.\n","See, Christians, Hindus, Sheiks, moderate Muslims, and I tell you from my experience Israel is a source of inspiration not just to us but to them as well, because it tells every single person on the face of the earth that you don't have -- a nation doesn't have to be large to be great. A nation doesn't have to be rich in natural resources to prosper.\n","Israel has been surrounded by enemies and yet it has shown that, even so, you can still be a democracy, still have a free press, still have an independent judiciary. Israel is the only country in the Middle East where a Palestinian can stand up on national television and criticize the government and the next day still be a free human being.\n","And so it was one of my visits to Hong Kong after the handover, I went to see Mr. Tung Chee-hwa, the Beijing appointment as head of Hong Kong. And I tell you this man, this Chinese appointment, was a lover of Jews and Judaism and Israel. He said to me, \"You know, your people and my people are very old people.\" \"You've been around 6,000 years. We've been around 5,000 years.\" \"Tell me, I always wanted to know, what did you do for the first thousand years before you had Kosher Chinese takeaways?\"\n","I said, Mr. Tung, \"You want to know what we did for the first thousand years? We complained about the food.\" And Mr. Tung said to me, \"I want to go and visit Israel because I see that as the model of development for here.\" And he did go two or three months later and came back absolutely inspired. And I went straight to the Israeli ambassador in London and said, \"Look how the world has changed. There was a time when Israel dreamed about being the Hong Kong of the Middle East; today Hong Kong dreams, halevai, we should be the Israel of the Far East.\"\n","So I wrote about this. You know, that's a very interesting word, \"probably.\" After all, how probable is it that the universe should exist? How probable is it that life should exist? How probable is it that out of all the three million life forms on the -- on the planet Earth, only one, us, [is] capable of asking the question \"Why\"? Nothing interesting is remotely probable.\n","And then I said, think about the Jewish people. How probable is it that one man, Abraham, who commanded no empire, ordered no army, performed no miracle, delivered no prophecy, should today without doubt be the most influential man who ever lived, who's claimed as the spiritual ancestor by 2.4 billion Christians, 1.6 billion Muslims, and most of you in the room today?\n","How likely is it that after 2,000 years of exile our people should have come back to our land and there in -- having stood eyeball to eyeball in Auschwitz a mere three years earlier, eyeball to eyeball with the Angel of Death, in 1948 said, despite the worst crime of man against man, lo amut kiechyeh -- \"I will not die but I will live?\" Israel is the greatest collective affirmation of life in the whole of Jewish history.\n","Friends, Judaism is the defeat of probability by the power of possibility. And nowhere will you see the power of possibility more than in the state of Israel today.\n","Israel has taken a barren land and made it bloom again.\n","Israel has taken an ancient language, the language of the Bible, and make it speak again.\n","Israel has taken the West's oldest faith and made it young again.\n","Israel has taken a shattered nation and make it live again.\n","Friends, let us not rest until Israel's light shines throughout the world, the world's great symbol of life and hope.\n","Amen. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the view from Europe is that AIPAC is something out of this world. it reminds me how things are looking like in Europe today. when I was a child, there was one line in the Haggadah that I never understood. --------------------------\n","624 \n","Original text: When I stood in Downing Street as Prime Minister for the first time this summer, I set out my mission to build a country that works for everyone. Today I want to talk a little more about what that means and lay out my vision for a truly meritocratic Britain that puts the interests of ordinary, working class people first.\n","We are facing a moment of great change as a nation. As we we leave the European Union, we must define an ambitious new role for ourselves in the world. That involves asking ourselves what kind of country we want to be: a confident, global trading nation that continues to play its full part on the world stage.\n","But at the same time, I believe we have a precious opportunity to step back and ask some searching questions about what kind of country we want to be here at home too.\n","In fact, it’s not just an opportunity, but a duty. Because one thing is clear. When the British people voted in the referendum, they did not just choose to leave the European Union. They were also expressing a far more profound sense of frustration about aspects of life in Britain and the way in which politics and politicians have failed to respond to their concerns.\n","Some voted for the first time in more than 30 years. Some for the first time ever. And they were inspired to do so because they saw a chance to reject the politics of \"business as usual\" and to demand real, profound change.\n","Fed up with being ignored or told that their priorities were somehow invalid, based on ignorance and misunderstanding, or even on occasion that they were simply wrong to voice the concerns that they did, they took their opportunity to send a very clear message: they will not be ignored anymore.\n","They want to take back control of the things that matter in their lives. They want a government that listens, understands and is on their side. They want change. And this government is going to deliver it.\n","Everything we do will be driven, not by the interests of the privileged few. Not by those with the loudest voices, the special interests, the greatest wealth or the access to influence. This government’s priorities are those of ordinary, working class people. People for whom life sometimes can be a struggle, but who get on with things without complaint.\n","They get on with their jobs -- sometimes two or even three of them -- because they have families to feed and support, bills to pay and because to work for a fair reward is the right thing to do.\n","They get on with their lives quietly, going about their business, going out to work, raising families, helping neighbors, making their communities what they are.\n","They don’t ask for much, but they want to know that the people that make the big decisions are on their side, working for them. They want to believe that everyone plays by the same rules and things are fair.\n","And above all they want to believe that if they uphold their end of the deal -- they do the right thing, they work hard, they pay their taxes -- then tomorrow will be better than today and their children will have a fair chance in life, the chance to go as far as their talents will take them.\n","These are not outrageous demands or ridiculous desires, but for too many of these people today life does not seem fair. They are the people who made real sacrifices after the financial crash in 2008, though they were in no way responsible.\n","They wonder if others -- some of whom really do bear responsibility for the crash -- did the same.\n","More than anything else, they worry -- truly worry -- that the changing world around them means that their children and grandchildren won’t have the same opportunities they have enjoyed in life.\n","They deserve a better deal.\n","And to give them that, we should take this opportunity to step back and pose a fundamental question: what kind of country -- what kind of society -- do we want to be?\n","I am clear about the answer.\n","I want Britain to be the world’s great meritocracy -- a country where everyone has a fair chance to go as far as their talent and their hard work will allow.\n","I want us to be a country where everyone plays by the same rules; where ordinary, working class people have more control over their lives and the chance to share fairly in the prosperity of the nation.\n","And I want Britain to be a place where advantage is based on merit not privilege; where it’s your talent and hard work that matter, not where you were born, who your parents are or what your accent sounds like.\n","Let us not underestimate what it will take to create that great meritocracy. It means taking on some big challenges, tackling some vested interests. Overcoming barriers that have been constructed over many years.\n","It means not being afraid to think differently about what disadvantage means, who we want to help and how we can help them. Because where once we reached for simple ways of labeling people disadvantaged and were quick to pose simple -- and often fairly blunt -- solutions, in these modern times disadvantage is much more complex.\n","It’s often hidden and less easy to identify. It’s caused by factors that are more indirect and tougher to tackle than ever before.\n","But tackle it we must if we are to give ordinary, working class people the better deal they deserve.\n","It means marking a significant shift in the way that government works in Britain too. Because government and politicians have for years talked the language of social justice -- where we help the very poorest -- and social mobility -- where we help the brightest among the poor.\n","But to make Britain a great meritocracy, we must move beyond this agenda and deliver real social reform across every layer of society so that those whom the system would currently miss -- those just above the threshold for help today yet those who are by no means rich or well off -- are given the help they need.\n","It means putting government firmly on the side of not only the poorest in our society, important though that is and will remain, but also of those in Britain who are working hard but just about managing. It means helping to make their lives a little easier; giving them greater control over the issues they care about the most.\n","This is the change we need. It will mean changing some of the philosophy underpinning how government thinks and acts. It will mean recalibrating how we approach policy development to ensure that everything we do as government helps to give a fair chance to those who are just getting by -- while still helping those who are even more disadvantaged.\n","I don’t pretend this change will be easy -- change rarely is -- but this is the change we need if we are to make Britain the great meritocracy I want it to be.\n","Over the coming weeks and months the government will set out an ambitious program of economic and social reform that will help us make this change and build a true meritocracy in our country.\n","But there is no more important place to start than education. Because if the central concern ordinary working class people have is that their children will not enjoy the same opportunities they have had in life, we need to ensure that there is a good school place for every child, and education provision that caters to the individual needs and abilities of every pupil.\n","We start from a position of strength. This government has a proud record of school reform. We have opened up the system, introducing a real diversity of provision. We have schools where teachers and headteachers are free to make the decisions that are best for them.\n","And through successful policies such as a renewed focus on learning the basics of reading in primary schools, and initiatives to help young people pursue a strong academic core of subjects at secondary level, we are ensuring that every child has the opportunity to develop the core knowledge that underpins everything else.\n","We have put control in the hands of parents and headteachers, and encouraged people from all walks of life who are passionate about education to bring their best ideas and innovations to our school system.\n","The Academies and Free Schools movement overseen by pioneers such as Andrew Adonis and Michael Gove has been a huge success and begun to build an education system fit for the future.\n","As a result, there are more good or outstanding schools today than ever before in our country. And there are now more than 1.4 million more pupils in schools rated good or outstanding than in 2010.\n","Our curriculum reforms mean that the proportion of pupils taking core academic subjects at GCSE is up by almost four-fifths. We are driving up school standards to match the best international comparisons, with a record number of pupils securing a place at one of our world-class universities this summer. We can be proud of these achievements but there is still a long way to go.\n","Because for too many children, a good school remains out of reach. There are still 1.25 million attending primary and secondary schools in England which are rated by Ofsted as requiring improvement or inadequate. If schools across the north and Midlands had the same average standards as those in the south, nearly 200,000 more children would be attending good schools.\n","Let’s be honest about what these statistics mean.\n","They mean that for far too many children in Britain, the chance they have in life is determined by where they live or how much money their parents have.\n","And they mean that for far too many ordinary working class people, no matter how hard they work, how many hours they put in or how many sacrifices they make, they cannot be confident that their children will get the chances they deserve.\n","For when you are working two jobs and struggling to make ends meet, it is no good being told that you can choose a better school for your children if you move to a different area or pay to go private. Those aren’t choices that you can make. And they are not choices that you should have to make.\n","So we need to go further, building on and extending our reforms so that we can truly say that there will be a good school place for every child, and one that caters to their individual needs.\n","But as we do it, we also need to change our philosophy and approach, because at the moment the school system works if you’re well off and can buy your way into the school you want, and it provides extra help and support if you’re from a disadvantaged family.\n","If you’re eligible for free school meals, and your parents earn less than £16,000 a year, then there is extra help on offer. That is good and right -- and as long as I am Prime Minister, the pupil premium for the poorest children will remain.\n","But the free school meals measure only captures a relatively small number of pupils whose parents are on income-related benefits.\n","If we are going to make the change we need and build a great meritocracy in Britain, we need to broaden our perspective and do more for the hidden disadvantaged: children whose parents are on modest incomes, who do not qualify for such benefits but who are, nevertheless, still only just getting by.\n","If you’re earning 19, 20, 21 thousand pounds a year, you’re not rich. You’re not well off. And you should know you have our support too.\n","At the moment there is no way to differentiate between the school experience of children from these families and those from the wealthiest 10 percent.\n","Policy has been skewed by the focus only on those in receipt of free school meals, when the reality is that there are thousands of children from ordinary working class families who are being let down by the lack of available good school places.\n","Putting this right means finding a way to identify these children and measuring their attainment and progress within the school system. That work is underway and is central to my vision of a school system that truly works for everyone.\n","But we must also deliver a radical increase in the capacity of the school system so that these families can be sure of their children getting good school places.\n","And this is really important. Because I don’t just want to see more school places but more good school places. And I don’t just want to see more new schools, but more good new schools that each in their way contribute to a diversity of provision that caters to the needs and abilities of each individual child, whoever they are and wherever they are from.\n","Every child should be given the opportunity to develop the crucial academic core. And thanks to our reforms that is increasingly the case. But people understand that every child is different too, with different talents, different interests, different dreams. To help them realize their potential and achieve those dreams we need a school system with the capacity and capability to respond to what they need.\n","So as we radically expand the number of good school places available to all families -- not just those who can afford to buy an expensive house, pay for an expensive private school, or fund the extra tuition their child needs to succeed -- I want to encourage more people, schools and institutions with something to offer to come forward and help.\n","In the last six years, we have seen individuals and communities put staggering amounts of time and effort into setting up good new schools. Some of the best state schools, charities, universities, private schools, and businesses have stepped forward to get involved.\n","And, increasingly, the best state schools are sponsoring the least good. This has been a revolution in our schools system.\n","But with 1.25 million children still attending schools that are struggling, we need to do much more to increase the capacity of the system so every child can get the education they deserve.\n","So let’s now build on the success of school reform, let’s encourage others to play their part, and let’s remove the barriers they face so we can do more.\n","Let’s sweep away those barriers and encourage more people to join us in the task of delivering a good school place for every child.\n","Let’s build a truly dynamic school system where schools and institutions learn from one another, support one another and help one another.\n","Let’s offer a diverse range of good schools that ensure the individual talents and abilities of every child are catered for.\n","That is my ambition.\n","And there are four specific proposals I want to talk about today that I believe will help.\n","Firstly, I want to build on the success we have already experienced when some of our great universities have stepped in to help by sponsoring or supporting a local school.\n","Universities have a huge amount to offer England’s schools. They have been part of the fabric of our education system since the 13th century and have had a profound impact on our schools over generations.\n","Recently we have seen The University of Cambridge establish The University of Cambridge Primary School and The University of Birmingham open an impressive new free school for secondary school pupils and sixth formers.\n","The new specialist Sixth Form, King’s College London Mathematics School, is already performing impressively and the University of Brighton is involved in sponsoring more than a dozen different primary and secondary schools.\n","These are the kinds of innovation I want to encourage. This kind of active engagement in building the capacity of our school system is in my view far more effective than spending huge sums on bursaries and other financial support that tackle the symptoms but not the cause.\n","The right for a university to charge the higher level of tuition fee has always been dependent on their ability to fulfill specified access requirements. And this year, in fulfilling these requirements, they are expected to spend over £400 million on bursaries and other forms of financial support for students.\n","Yet the evidence is clear: It is the attainment of pupils at school that is the over-riding factor in predicting access to university.\n","I am not saying there is no place for bursaries. But overall, I do think the balance has tilted too far. We need to go to the root of the problem, which is that there are not enough students from disadvantaged backgrounds and from ordinary families fulfilling their potential with the grades to get into the best universities.\n","So I want our universities to do more to help us to improve the quality of schools so that more students of all backgrounds have the grades, the subjects, and the confidence, to apply to top universities and to be successful in their exams in the first place.\n","So the government will reform university fair access requirements and say that universities should actively strengthen state school attainment -- by sponsoring a state school or setting up a new free school. And over time we will extend this to the sponsorship or establishment of more than one school, so that in the future we see our universities sponsoring thriving school chains in every town and city in the country.\n","Second, I want to remove the obstacles that stop more good faith schools from opening.\n","Britain has a long history of faith schools delivering outstanding education. They already account for around a third of all mainstream schools in England. They are popular with parents and significantly more likely than other schools to be rated by Ofsted as good or outstanding.\n","I believe we should confidently promote them and the role they play in a diverse school system.\n","Yet for Catholic schools in particular there are barriers in their way. When a faith-designated free school is oversubscribed, it must limit the number of pupils it selects on the basis of faith to 50 percent.\n","The intention is to improve the diversity of the school’s intake but in practice it has little impact on many Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu schools because they tend not to appeal to parents of other faiths.\n","So despite the best intentions, the rule is failing in its objective to promote integration. But it does prevent new Catholic schools opening, because the Catholic Church believes it contravenes its own rules for a Catholic bishop not to prioritize the admission of Catholic pupils.\n","This is especially frustrating because existing Catholic schools are more ethnically diverse than other faith schools, more likely to be located in deprived communities, more likely to be rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, and there is growing demand for them.\n","So we will remove this 50 perdent rule to allow the growth in capacity that Catholic schools can offer. Instead we will consult on a new set of much more effective requirements to ensure that faith schools are properly inclusive and make sure their pupils mix with children of other faiths and backgrounds.\n","Of course, there must be strict and properly enforced rules to ensure that every new faith school operates in a way that supports British values. And we should explore new ways of using the school system to promote greater integration within our society generally.\n","We will encourage the grouping together of mono-racial and mono-religious schools within wider multi-racial and multi-religious trusts. This will make it easier for children from different backgrounds in more divided communities to mix between schools, while respecting religious differences.\n","We will explore ways in which schools can enter into twinning arrangements with other schools not of their faith, through sharing lessons or joint extra-curricular activities to bring young people from different schools together.\n","And we will consult on the idea of placing an independent member or director who is of a different faith or no faith at all on the governing body of new faith schools.\n","We will also explore new requirements for new faith schools to prove that parents of other faiths would be happy to send their children to the school through a proper process of consultation.\n","But fundamentally I believe it is wrong to deny families the opportunity to send their children to a school that reflects their religious values if that’s what they choose. And it’s right to encourage faith communities -- especially those with a proven record of success, like the Catholics -- to play their full part in building the capacity of our schools.\n","Third, I want to encourage some of our biggest independent schools to bring their knowledge, expertise and resources to bear to help improve the quality and capacity of schools for those who cannot afford to pay.\n","This is entirely in keeping with the ethos that lies at the heart of many of these institutions. Most of the major public schools started out as the route by which poor boys could reach the professions. The nature of their intake may have changed today -- indeed these schools have become more and more divorced from normal life.\n","Between 2010 and 2015 their fees rose 4 times faster than average earnings growth, while the percentage of their pupils who come from overseas has gone up by 33 percent since 2008. But I know that their commitment to giving something back to the wider community remains.\n","These are great schools with a lot to offer and I certainly don’t believe you solve the divide between the rich and the rest by abolishing or demolishing them. You do it by extending their reach and asking them to do more as a condition of their privileged position to help all children.\n","Through their charitable status, private schools collectively reduce their tax bills by millions every year. And I want to consult on how we can amend Charity Commission guidance for independent schools to enact a tougher test on the amount of public benefit required to maintain charitable status.\n","It’s important to state that this will be proportionate to the size and scale of the school in question. Not every school is an Eton or a Harrow. Many public schools are nowhere near that size.\n","Smaller independent schools who do not have the capacity to take on full sponsorship of a local state school will be asked to provide more limited help such as direct school-to-school support where appropriate. This could include supporting teaching in minority subjects such as further maths or classics, which state schools often struggle to make viable. It could include ensuring their senior leaders become directors of multi-academy trusts; providing greater access to their facilities and providing sixth-form scholarships to a proportion of pupils in year 11 at each local school.\n","But for those with the capacity and capability, we will ask them to go further and actually sponsor or set up a new government-funded school in the state sector and take responsibility for running it and ensuring its success.\n","Alternatively, we will ask them to fund a number of places at their own school themselves for those from modest backgrounds who cannot afford to pay the fees.\n","We know this can work. For example, Westminster School is the key partner in sponsoring Harris Westminster Sixth Form, where students at the free school share the facilities and teaching expertise of Westminster School.\n","In my own constituency, Eton College sponsors Holyport College, offering Holyport pupils access to its sports facilities and the chance to join its educational activities.\n","And before it became a state-funded academy, Belvedere School in Liverpool worked with the Sutton Trust to create an Open Access Scheme where places were awarded purely on the basis of academic merit, and parents were then asked to pay on a sliding scale of fees fairly tailored according to their means.\n","I want all independent schools with the appropriate capacity and capability to take these kinds of steps.\n","I want them to play a major role in creating more good school places for children from ordinary working families; because this government is about a Britain that works for everyone -- not just a privileged few.\n","There is one final area where we have placed obstacles in the way of good new schools -- obstacles that I believe we need to take away.\n","The debate over selective schools has raged for years. But the only place it has got us to is a place where selection exists if you’re wealthy -- if you can afford to go private -- but doesn’t exist if you’re not. We are effectively saying to poorer and some of the most disadvantaged children in our country that they can’t have the kind of education their richer counterparts can enjoy.\n","What is ‘just’ about that? Where is the meritocracy in a system that advantages the privileged few over the many? How can a meritocratic Britain let this situation stand?\n","Politicians -- many of whom benefited from the very kind of education they now seek to deny to others -- have for years put their own dogma and ideology before the interests and concerns of ordinary people. For we know that grammar schools are hugely popular with parents. We know they are good for the pupils that attend them. Indeed, the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils is reduced to almost zero for children in selective schools. And we know that they want to expand.\n","They provide a stretching education for the most academically able, regardless of their background, and they deliver outstanding results.\n","In fact, 99 percent of existing selective schools are rated good or outstanding -- and 80 percent are outstanding, compared with just 20 percent of state schools overall.\n","So we help no one -- not least those who can’t afford to move house or pay for a private education -- by saying to parents who want a selective education for their child that we won’t let them have it.\n","There is nothing meritocratic about standing in the way of giving our most academically gifted children the specialist and tailored support that can enable them to fulfill their potential. In a true meritocracy, we should not be apologetic about stretching the most academically able to the very highest standards of excellence.\n","We already have selection to help achieve this in specialist disciplines like music and sport, giving exceptionally talented young people access to the facilities and training that can help them become world class. I think we should have more of this. But we should also take the same approach to support the most academically gifted too.\n","Frankly, it is completely illogical to make it illegal to open good new schools. So I want to relax the restrictions that stop selective schools from expanding, that deny parents the right to have a new selective school opened where they want one, and that stop existing non-selective schools to become selective in the right circumstances and where there is demand.\n","In return, we will ensure that these schools contribute meaningfully to raising outcomes for all pupils in every part of the system.\n","In practice this could mean taking a proportion of pupils from lower income households, so that selective education is not reserved for those with the means to move into a catchment area or pay for tuition to pass the test.\n","They could, as a condition of opening a new selective school, be asked to establish a good, new non-selective school. Others may be asked to establish a primary feeder school in an area with a high density of lower income households to widen access. They might even partner with an existing non-selective school within a multi-academy trust or sponsor a currently underperforming non-selective academy.\n","But the principle is clear: selective schools have a part to play in helping to expand the capacity of our school system and they have the ability to cater to the individual needs of every child. So the government will make up to £50 million a year available to support the expansion of good or outstanding existing grammars.\n","Now I know this will be the source of much debate in the consultation over the coming months, so I want to address very directly some of the key arguments made by those who oppose the expansion of grammar schools.\n","First, there are those who fear this could lead to the return of a binary system, as we had in the past with secondary moderns. But this fear is unfounded: there will be no return to secondary moderns.\n","As I have set out today, far from a binary system we are supporting the most diverse school system we have ever had in our country.\n","From free schools sponsored by universities and independent schools, to faith schools and selective schools, the diversity of high quality school provision means we will be able to cater properly for the different needs of all pupils and give parents real control over the kind of school they want for their children.\n","We do not want to see whole new parts of the country where the choice of schools is binary. So we will use the approvals process to prevent that from happening.\n","Second, there are those who argue that selective schools tend to recruit children from more affluent backgrounds. The problem here is not selective schools per se but rather the way that wealthier families can already dominate access to the schools of their choice through selection by house price. I want to stop that and new grammars can help.\n","We are going to ask new grammars to demonstrate that they will attract pupils from different backgrounds, for example as I said, by taking a proportion of children from lower income households. And existing grammars will be expected to do more too -- by working with local primary schools to help children from more disadvantaged backgrounds to apply.\n","Third, there are those who argue that grammars don’t actually select on ability because wealthy families can pay tutors to help their children get through the tests. This might have been the case in the past with the old 11-plus. But it does not have to be the case today.\n","While there is no such thing as a tutor-proof test, many selective schools are already employing much smarter tests that assess the true potential of every child. So new grammars will be able to select in a fair and meritocratic way, not on the ability of parents to pay.\n","Fourth, there are those who worry about the cliff-edge of selection at 11. Some fear it is too early, some fear it is too late. The truth is that it doesn’t have to be a cliff-edge at all. This is back in the old mindset of the grammar schools of the past. A modern, meritocratic education system needs to be much more flexible and agile to respond to the needs of every child. So we will demand that new grammars make the most of their freedom to be flexible over how students move between schools, encouraging this to happen at different ages such as 14 and 16 as well as 11.\n","This means that children who are at a non-selective school sponsored by a grammar might join the grammar for specific subjects or specialisms where they themselves are outstanding -- or they might move to the grammar full-time later than aged 11, based on their performance at their current school.\n","Finally, people get lost in the argument about whether the grammars schools of the 1950s and 60s improved social mobility or not. But I want to focus on the new grammars of the future: those that will be just one element of a truly diverse system which taken as a whole can give every child the support they need to go as far as their talents can take them. And give every parent access to a good school place for their child.\n","This is the true test of schools that work for everyone. And the true test of a meritocratic society.\n","There has been a lot of speculation in the last few weeks, but as you now know this is not a proposal to go back to a binary model of grammars and secondary moderns but to build on our increasingly diverse schools system. It is not a proposal to go back to the 1950s but to look to the future, and that future I believe is an exciting one.\n","It is a future in which every child should have access to a good school place. And a future in which Britain’s education system shifts decisively to support ordinary working class families.\n","These families are not asking for the world. They just want to know that their children and grandchildren will enjoy the opportunities they have enjoyed and be given the chance to go as far as their talents will take them. Unhindered by background or circumstance. And by the artificial barriers some want to put in their way.\n","In a country that works for everyone it doesn’t matter where you were born, or how much your parents earn. If you work hard and do the right thing, you will be able to go as far as you can.\n","I want this country to be a great meritocracy. I want to see more houses built, better productivity so we can have more well-paid jobs, more economic growth not just in the south-east of England but across the whole country to help more people get on.\n","But more than anything else, I want to see children from ordinary, working class families given the chances their richer contemporaries take for granted. That means we need more great schools.\n","This is the plan to deliver them and to set Britain on the path to being the great meritocracy of the world. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," we must define an ambitious new role for ourselves in the world. we are facing a moment of great change as we leave the europe - we need to define our role in our world. if you want to be able to live in your country, you have to ask yourself what kind of country we want. --------------------------\n","625 \n","Original text: President Obama: Hi, everybody. I've got a special guest with me this week: Macklemore. Now, for those of you who don't share the same love for hip-hop that I do, he's a Grammy-winning artist, but he is also an advocate who's giving voice to a disease that we too often just whisper about: the disease of addiction.\n","Macklemore: Hey, everybody. I'm here with President Obama because I take this personally. I abused prescription drugs and I battled addiction. If I hadn't gotten the help that I needed when I needed it, I definitely would not be here today. And I want to help others facing the same challenges that I did.\n","President Obama: And drug overdoses now take more lives every year than traffic accidents. Deaths from opioid overdoses have tripled since 2000. A lot of [the] time, they're from legal drugs prescribed by a doctor. So, addiction doesn't always start in some dark alley; it often starts in a medicine cabinet. In fact, a new study released this month found that 44 percent of Americans know someone who has been addicted to prescription pain killers.\n","Macklemore: I didn't just know someone -- I lost someone. My friend Kevin overdosed on painkillers when he was just 21 years old. Addiction is like any other disease -- it doesn't discriminate. It doesn't care what color you are, whether you're a guy or a girl, rich or poor, whether you live in a[n] inner-city, a suburb, or rural America. This doesn't just happen to other people's kids or in some other neighborhood. It can happen to any of us.\n","President Obama: That's why just talking about this crisis isn't enough. We need to get treatment to more people who need it. My Administration is working with communities to reduce overdose deaths, including with medication. We're working with law enforcement to help people get into treatment instead of jail. And under Obamacare, health plans in the Marketplace have to include coverage for treatment.\n","Macklemore: I know recovery isn't easy or quick, but along with the 12-step program, treatment has saved my life. And recovery works. We need our leaders in Washington to fund it, and for people to know how to find it.\n","President Obama: We all need to do more to make that happen. I've asked Congress to expand access to recovery services, and to give first responders the tools they need to treat overdoses before it's too late. This week, the House passed several bills about opioids -- which is great -- but unless they also make investments in more treatment, it won't get Americans the help that they need. On top of funding, doctors also need more training about the power of pain medication they prescribe, and the risks that those pain medications carry. Another way our country can help those suffering in private is to make this conversation public.\n","Macklemore: When you're going through it, it's hard to imagine there could be anything worse than addiction. But shame and the stigma associated with the disease keeps too many people from seeking the help that they actually need. Addiction isn't a personal choice or a personal failing, and sometimes it takes more than a strong will to get better. It takes a strong community and accessible resources.\n","President Obama: The good news is, there's hope. When we talk about opioid abuse as the public health problem that it is, more people will seek the help that they need. More people will find the strength to recover, just like Macklemore and millions of Americans have. We'll see fewer preventable deaths and fewer broken families.\n","Macklemore: We have to tell people who need help that it's okay to ask for it. We've got to make sure they know where to get it.\n","President Obama: We all have a role to play. Even if we haven't fought this battle in our own lives, there's a good chance we know someone who has -- or who is.\n","Macklemore: President Obama and I just had a powerful conversation here at the White House about opioid abuse and what we can do about it. You can catch it this summer on MTV. And to find treatment in your area, call 1-800-662-HELP.\n","President Obama: Thanks, everybody. Thanks, Macklemore.\n","Macklemore: Thank you.\n","President Obama: And have a great weekend. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," president: drug overdoses now take more lives every year than traffic accidents. 44 percent of americans know someone who has been addicted to prescription pain killers, he says. --------------------------\n","626 \n","Original text: Thank you. Thank you, Vanessa.\n","Well, it is an incredible experience to be here tonight. And I have to admit that it hasn't been easy to sift through years of memories about my father and find those few that might best tell you who John Kerry really is. So, let me just begin with one July day, when Vanessa and I were kids. It's a silly story, but it's true, and it's one of my favorite memories about my father.\n","We were standing on a dock, waiting for a boat to take us on a summer trip. Vanessa, the scientist, had packed all of her animals, including her favorite hamster. Our over-zealous golden retriever got tangled in his leash and knocked the hamster cage off the dock. We watched, as \"Licorice,\" the unlucky hamster -- as he became termed -- bubbled down into a watery doom.\n","Now, that might have been the end of the story: A mock funeral at sea and some tears for a hamster lost. But my dad jumped in, grabbed an oar, fished the cage from the water, hunched over the soggy hamster, and began to administer CPR.\n","Now -- Now there are still to this day, there are some reports of mouth-to-mouth, but I admit it's probably a trick of memory.\n","The hamster was never quite right after that, but he lived.\n","Now like I said, it may sound silly, and we still laugh about it today, but it was serious to us. And that's what mattered to my father.\n","Years later, when I was driving back to college with him, brooding, as only a 19-year-old can, my father told me to look outside the car.\n","He said, \"Allie, this is a beautiful day. Feel the sun. Look at the country you live in.\"\n","The passion of his words makes me remember them still, ten years later.\n","He said to me, \"I know men your exact age who thought they'd have the same future you have, whose families were never born, who never again walked on American soil. They don't feel this sun.\"\n","\"Allie,\" he said, \"If there's something you don't like, something that needs to be changed, change it. But never, ever give up.\"\n","\"Remember,\" he said, \"Remember that you are alive and that you are an American. Those two things make you the luckiest little girl in the world.\"\n","Even now -- Even now, I look back at that and I think about what my dad has been through in his life. Because he's quiet about those things, my sister and I had to sneak upstairs when we were kids and read his letters from Vietnam. Who knew a 23-year-old could have seen so much so young.\n","To every little girl, her father is a hero. And it's taken some getting used to, but my father actually is one.\n","And it's not just -- it's not just in the obvious ways, because he likes to listen as much as he likes to talk; because he's studious in the ways someone is when everything in the whole world interests them; because he leads by example; because he trusts people with the truth, and doesn't play to our baser instincts.\n","And let me tell you this -- thank you -- let me tell you this: When he loves you, as he loves me and my sister and his family, as he loves the men who fought beside him, there is no sacrifice too great. And when he cares for you, as he cares for this country, there are no surer hands and no wiser heart.

I believe we're up to 48 countries around the world that have recognized him. As many of you know, there are meetings, yesterday and today in Uruguay, about the crisis in Venezuela. One, an Uruguay and Mexico-led meeting; another, the International Contact Group on Venezuela.\n","Instead of trying to accommodate Maduro through contact groups or dialogue, we urge countries to recognize Juan Guaido as interim president and join us in responding to his call for immediate international humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the Venezuelan people.\n","Maduro has proven he will manipulate any call for negotiations to his advantage, and he has often used so-called dialogues as a way to play for time. We urge all involved to deal solely with the legitimate Guaido government. The time for dialogue with Maduro has long passed. Every day that Maduro remains in power is a day where political prisoners remain in jail, detainees are abused, and Venezuelans go without food and medicine.\n","The contrast between Interim President Guaido and Maduro is striking. While Mr. Guaido calls for humanitarian assistance for the people of Venezuela -- excuse me -- While Guaido calls for humanitarian assistance for the people of Venezuela, Maduro continues to block unhindered access to international humanitarian assistance, and denies Venezuelans the basic necessities they direly need, unless they declare loyalty to him. The U.S. Government is coordinating with Guaido and his team of experts, other governments in the region, our humanitarian partners, on the logistics of deploying aid to mobilize a response efficiently and safely. We are prepositioning items -- relief items, food, nutritional supplements, hygiene kits, medical kits in Colombia so that they're available to reach Venezuelans in need in their own country as soon as that is safe and logistically possible.\n","I would like to state that we are imposing visa restrictions and revoking the visas of members of the illegitimate Constituent [National] Assembly. This body has usurped many of the constitutional powers of the National Assembly, the legitimate National Assembly, and embodies Maduro's destruction of democratic institutions. While I cannot name names because visa information is protected, I can state that we will continue to take action against those destroying Venezuela's democratic institutions.\n","Thank you.\n","Mr. Palladino: We have time for a few questions. Matt.\n","Question: Thanks, Robert. Just on the contact group, you mentioned at the beginning that 23 European countries now recognize Guaido. And yet the EU was the primary organizer of the contact group. So I'm wondering, one, if you guys were invited to join and said no for the reasons that you outlined, that the time for dialogue is past. And secondly, if 23 European countries have already de-recognized Maduro, how do you think that the contact group was -- try to get to dialogue?\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, I hope they're going to follow the position of the United States, which is that the only worthwhile message to the Maduro regime is it's time to end the dictatorship in Venezuela. The question is really what is the purpose of the contact group, and we'll find out when they issue a, know, a final statement. But our messages to the members of the cont[a]ct group have been don't fall into a trap that Maduro has set many times before, where there's a phony dialogue rather than a strong message to him: It's time to go.\n","Question: Right. But did you decline an opportunity to be part of the contact group?\n","Mr. Abrams: I don't believe we were ever interested in joining the contact group, because we don't think that's the way to go.\n","Question: Thank you.\n","Mr. Palladino: Let's go to Bloomberg. Nick Wadhams.\n","Question: Mr. Abrams, can you talk about what the U.S. has in mind for Nicolas Maduro himself? John Bolton tweeted that he'd be happy to see him on a beach somewhere. Would you care where he goes? Would the U.S. seek to have him face justice of some sort? Or do you have anything in mind for what the endgame for him ought to be?\n","Mr. Abrams: The endgame for him should be to leave power, and the sooner the better. Because his own situation is only going to decline the longer he clings to power and the more misery there is in Venezuela.\n","Question: But where would you like to see him go? Should he remain in Venezuela or leave the country?\n","Mr. Abrams: I think it is better for the transition to democracy in Venezuela that he be outside the country. And there are a number of countries that I think would be willing to accept him.\n","Question: Which ones?\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, he's got friends in places like Cuba and Russia, and there are some other countries actually that have come to us privately and said they'd be willing to take members of the current illegitimate regime if it would help the transition.\n","Question: Can you name any?\n","Mr. Abrams: No.\n","Mr. Palladino: Let's go to Reuters.\n","Question: Mr. Abrams, isn't it rather rich given your background --\n","Mr. Palladino: Excuse me, sir, no. No. Give order. No, no, no, no.\n","Question: Do we have a free press here or not?\n","Question: Mr. Abrams.\n","Mr. Palladino: Reuters. Hang on. It's Reuters.\n","Question: Hello. How are you?\n","Question: Freedom and democracy. That what's going on here?\n","Question: So two questions, quickly. Is -- you say time has long passed to negotiate with Maduro, but this is a different situation in which he -- you have an opposition leader that has come forward and that is willing and has united the opposition, as -- as you've claimed. Number two: How are you going to get the aid into Venezuela when Maduro still has the military behind him and he controls the -- all of the territory?\n","Mr. Abrams: It is probably correct that the Venezuelan army, if mobilized, could prevent international aid from reaching Venezuela. That would be a really tragic situation. And we are hopeful that that won't happen.\n","We saw the blocking of the bridge in Cucuta. But members of the army are Venezuelan citizens. They have parents and children and brothers and sisters who are suffering badly. So our hope is that they will be able to persuade Maduro, or they will simply disobey orders to continue the starvation of the -- of the people of Venezuela.\n","As to discussions with Maduro, negotiating with him on his departure is fine, if we ever get to that negotiation. Obviously, he may flee someday or he may seek to negotiate conditions. But that's not what he's done in the past. What he's done in the past is to use these negotiations to prolong his stay in power and to try to demonstrate his legitimacy. And that, we're against.\n","Mr. Palladino: Let's go to Fox, Rich Edson.\n","Question: Mr. Abrams, you've been accused of --\n","Mr. Palladino: Excuse me, sir. Fox [inaudible].\n","Question: How long can you say that --\n","Question: [Inaudible.]\n","Mr. Palladino: Fox.\n","Question: When did the --\n","Question: [Inaudible] rich for you to be talking about political riots and starving people [inaudible] --\n","Question: When did the Administration become aware of Mr. Guaido, and how long has he been -- has the Administration been working with Mr. Guaido?\n","Mr. Abrams: I can't actually answer that question, because I've been here for too short a time. His -- He was an elected member of the National Assembly in one of the major parties in the group of four leading democratic parties. So I think it depends also who -- if you ask me, for example, when did Ambassador Todd or when did now Chargé [d’ Affaires] [James] Story know of him, I'm sure they've known him a long time. Obviously, he's gotten a lot more famous recently.\n","Question: And are you confident that he's been sufficiently vetted, especially as this has gone on now for the last [few] weeks?\n","Mr. Abrams: Yes, and I think -- you know the pressure that he's under. You saw the incident that happened just a few days ago, where police entered his own home, his apartment where his 20-month-old daughter was. Think of the pressures that he's under. I think that the leadership that he is giving to the Venezuelan people is really quite extraordinary.\n","Mr. Palladino: Let's go to ABC.\n","Question: [Off-mike.]\n","Question: Mr. Abrams, just in follow-up to something that you said to Lesley, you talked about you're hopeful that the Maduro regime wouldn't block aid --\n","Mr. Abrams: Yeah.\n","Question: -- coming across the border. Does that mean that you intend, with your partner countries, perhaps with NGOs, to begin moving that aid without explicit permission to do so?\n","Mr. Abrams: We will be moving aid to the border of Venezuela in the hope that -- and there is some aid there now -- in the hope that we will be able to get it in. I don't think that we or the Colombians or the Brazilians or anyone else is planning to try to force it in. It's an extraordinary situation, if you think about it. You've seen the statistics about hunger, about the closure of hospitals, about the spread of communicable diseases that had been eradicated, because now there cannot be vaccinations. There are dire needs, and I think many people, again, in the Venezuelan army feel those needs for themselves and their families. So we're hopeful that that at least initial decision on the part of Maduro can be turned around, if he sees a real demand on the part of the people of Venezuela. Let it in. That's all we're asking. Let. It. In.\n","Mr. Palladino: Let's go to Voice of America. Nike, please.\n","Question: How about the sanctions [inaudible] that the U.S. special rapporteur says that sanctions [inaudible] --\n","Question: Thank you. Sir, you just mentioned the visa restriction. And do you -- is there any discussion on any sanction regarding the regimes or governments that continue to support and help Maduro regime and sabotaging the democratic -- democratic transition? Separately, there is a perception in China and in other countries that U.S. is interfering in domestic politics. What's your response to those criticism? Thank you.\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, there has been interference in the domestic politics of Venezuela for a long time, primarily by Cuba, which has a very large presence in Venezuela. If you look around at the -- the now nearly 50 democracies that are supporting Interim-President Guaido and the National Assembly, it's hard really to say that all of those countries are engaged in some kind of joint effort to interfere. What we're trying to do is help Venezuelans create a system where, if you will, they can interfere in their own internal affairs, where their politics is in the hands of the Venezuelan people, where the future of their country can be determined by -- in a free election by the people of Venezuela.\n","Question: How about sanction against governments like support --\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, the sanctions that -- that exist now, that...have been enacted, are not secondary sanctions; they're primary sanctions. We will continue to speak to governments around the world, urging them to get on the right side of this issue, which is the side of supporting the people of -- of Venezuela and leading toward a transition and a free election there. We will keep pushing.\n","Question: [Inaudible] the U.S. [inaudible] interfering in any way?\n","Mr. Palladino: Let's go to CBS, Christina Ruffini.\n","Question: Thank you. Mr. Abrams, I spoke with Ambassadors [Story] and Vecchio this morning, and I asked them about this 30-day deadline. You know, in the constitution he was able to take power, but it says only for 30 days. And they're confident with the situation on the ground as it is that the public and the constitution gives them time to fix this. But I'm wondering if there's any kind of concern -- as we pass that 30-day mark and the clock starts to tick down -- if the Guaido government can't take control, if they start to lose momentum, that we could see this fall apart.\n","Mr. Abrams: Well, I don't think so. First, I don't think they're going to lose momentum; they seem to be gaining momentum, as more and more countries join this struggle to support the people of Venezuela. If it is true that at the end of 30 days it has not been possible to have -- to begin a transition to a free election and an elected, democratic government, the fall will be that of the regime, so I doubt that it will have any repercussions on the National Assembly and Mr. Guaido.\n","Question: But don't you think that if there are two presidents of Venezuela, neither of whom --\n","Mr. Abrams: There is only one president of Venezuela, and there is a former president of Venezuela.\n","Mr. Palladino: All right. Last question, Michel, please.\n","Question: An update on the U.S. diplomats in Venezuela, their security, their protection, and the U.S. presence in -- in general?\n","Mr. Abrams: As you've heard the Secretary say many times -- that there's no greater priority for him, for the Department [of State], than the safety of our officials on the ground around the world. That remains a concern. It gets a lot of attention here.

It's the word that gets everybody upset when you say it, and the word that many, or the phrase that many politicians are afraid to say, and that is: global warming. I have spoken more about global warming than any other politician in Washington today. My speech will be a bit different from the previous seven floor speeches, as I focus not only on the science, but on the media's coverage of climate change.\n","Global Warming -- just that term evokes many members in this chamber, the media, Hollywood elites and our pop culture to nod their heads and fret about an impending climate disaster. As the senator who has spent more time educating about the actual facts about global warming, I want to address some of the recent media coverage of global warming and Hollywood's involvement in the issue. And of course I will also discuss former Vice President Al Gore's movie \"An Inconvenient Truth.\"\n","Since 1895, the media has alternated between global cooling and warming scares during four separate and sometimes overlapping time periods. From 1895 until the 1930's the media pedaled a coming ice age.\n","From the late 1920's until the 1960's they warned of global warming. From the 1950's until the 1970's they warned us again of a coming ice age. This makes modern global warming the fourth estate's fourth attempt to promote opposing climate change fears during the last 100 years.\n","Recently, advocates of alarmism have grown increasingly desperate to try to convince the public that global warming is the greatest moral issue of our generation. Just last week, the vice president of London's Royal Society sent a chilling letter to the media encouraging them to stifle the voices of scientists skeptical of climate alarmism. During the past year, the American people have been served up an unprecedented parade of environmental alarmism by the media and entertainment industry, which link every possible weather event to global warming. The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media dismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate change coverage and instead crossed squarely into global warming advocacy.\n","First, I would like to summarize some of the recent developments in the controversy over whether or not humans have created a climate catastrophe. One of the key aspects that the United Nations, environmental groups and the media have promoted as the \"smoking gun\" of proof of catastrophic global warming is the so-called 'hockey stick' temperature graph by climate scientist Michael Mann and his colleagues.\n","This graph purported to show that temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere remained relatively stable over 900 years, then spiked upward in the 20th century presumably due to human activity. Mann, who also co-publishes a global warming propaganda blog reportedly set up with the help of an environmental group, had his \"Hockey Stick\" come under severe scrutiny.\n","The \"hockey stick\" was completely and thoroughly broken once and for all in 2006. Several years ago, two Canadian researchers tore apart the statistical foundation for the hockey stick. In 2006, both the National Academy of Sciences and an independent researcher further refuted the foundation of the \"hockey stick.\"\n","The National Academy of Sciences report reaffirmed the existence of the Medieval Warm Period from about 900 AD to 1300 AD and the Little Ice Age from about 1500 to 1850. Both of these periods occurred long before the invention of the SUV or human industrial activity could have possibly impacted the Earth's climate. In fact, scientists believe the Earth was warmer than today during the Medieval Warm Period, when the Vikings grew crops in Greenland.\n","Climate alarmists have been attempting to erase the inconvenient Medieval Warm Period from the Earth's climate history for at least a decade. David Deming, an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma's College of Geosciences, can testify first hand about this effort.\n","Dr. Deming was welcomed into the close-knit group of global warming believers after he published a paper in 1995 that noted some warming in the 20th century. Deming says he was subsequently contacted by a prominent global warming alarmist and told point blank \"We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.\" When the \"Hockey Stick\" first appeared in 1998, it did just that.\n","The media have missed the big pieces of the puzzle when it comes to the Earth's temperatures and mankind's carbon dioxide (C02) emissions. It is very simplistic to feign horror and say the one degree Fahrenheit temperature increase during the 20th century means we are all doomed. First of all, the one degree Fahrenheit rise coincided with the greatest advancement of living standards, life expectancy, food production and human health in the history of our planet. So it is hard to argue that the global warming we experienced in the 20th century was somehow negative or part of a catastrophic trend.\n","Second, what the climate alarmists and their advocates in the media have continued to ignore is the fact that the Little Ice Age, which resulted in harsh winters which froze New York Harbor and caused untold deaths, ended about 1850. So trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.\n","In addition, something that the media almost never addresses are the holes in the theory that C02 has been the driving force in global warming. Alarmists fail to adequately explain why temperatures began warming at the end of the Little Ice Age in about 1850, long before man-made CO2 emissions could have impacted the climate. Then about 1940, just as man-made CO2 emissions rose sharply, the temperatures began a decline that lasted until the 1970's, prompting the media and many scientists to fear a coming ice age. Let me repeat, temperatures got colder after C02 emissions exploded. If C02 is the driving force of global climate change, why do so many in the media ignore the many skeptical scientists who cite these rather obvious inconvenient truths?\n","My skeptical views on man-made catastrophic global warming have only strengthened as new science comes in. There have been recent findings in peer-reviewed literature over the last few years showing that the Antarctic is getting colder and the ice is growing and a new study in Geophysical Research Letters found that the sun was responsible for 50% of 20th century warming.\n","Recently, many scientists, including a leading member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, predicted long-term global cooling may be on the horizon due to a projected decrease in the sun's output.\n","A letter sent to the Canadian Prime Minister on April 6 of this year by 60 prominent scientists who question the basis for climate alarmism, clearly explains the current state of scientific knowledge on global warming.\n","The 60 scientists wrote: \"If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary.\"\n","The letter also noted:\n","Climate change is real' is a meaningless phrase used repeatedly by activists to convince the public that a climate catastrophe is looming and humanity is the cause. Neither of these fears is justified. Global climate changes occur all the time due to natural causes and the human impact still remains impossible to distinguish from this natural 'noise.'\n","One of the ways alarmists have pounded this mantra of \"consensus\" on global warming into our pop culture is through the use of computer models which project future calamity. But the science is simply not there to place so much faith in scary computer model scenarios which extrapolate the current and projected buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and conclude that the planet faces certain doom.\n","Dr. Vincent Gray, a research scientist and a 2001 reviewer with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has noted, \"The effects of aerosols, and their uncertainties, are such as to nullify completely the reliability of any of the climate models.\"\n","Earlier this year, the director of the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks Alaska, testified to Congress that highly publicized climate models showing a disappearing Arctic were nothing more than \"science fiction.\"\n","In fact, after years of hearing about the computer generated scary scenarios about the future of our planet, I now believe that the greatest climate threat we face may be coming from alarmist computer models.\n","This threat is originating from the software installed on the hard drives of the publicity seeking climate modelers.\n","It is long past the time for us to separate climate change fact from hysteria.\n","One final point on the science of climate change: I am approached by many in the media and others who ask, \"What if you are wrong to doubt the dire global warming predictions? Will you be able to live with yourself for opposing the Kyoto Protocol?\"\n","My answer is blunt. The history of the modern environmental movement is chock full of predictions of doom that never came true. We have all heard the dire predictions about the threat of overpopulation, resource scarcity, mass starvation, and the projected death of our oceans. None of these predictions came true, yet it never stopped the doomsayers from continuing to predict a dire environmental future.\n","The more the eco-doomsayers' predictions fail, the more the eco-doomsayers predict. These failed predictions are just one reason I respect the serious scientists out there today debunking the latest scaremongering on climate change. Scientists like MIT's Richard Lindzen, former Colorado State climatologist Roger Pielke, Sr., the University of Alabama's Roy Spencer and John Christy, Virginia State Climatologist Patrick Michaels, Colorado State University's William Gray, atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer, Willie Soon of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Oregon State climatologist George Taylor and astrophysicist Sallie Baliunas, to name a few.\n","But more importantly, it is the global warming alarmists who should be asked the question -- \"What if they are correct about man-made catastrophic global warming?\" -- because they have come up with no meaningful solution to their supposed climate crisis in the two decades that they have been hyping this issue.\n","If the alarmists truly believe that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are dooming the planet, then they must face up to the fact that symbolism does not solve a supposed climate crisis.\n","The alarmists freely concede that the Kyoto Protocol, even if fully ratified and complied with, would not have any meaningful impact on global temperatures. And keep in mind that Kyoto is not even close to being complied with by many of the nations that ratified it, including 13 of the EU-15 nations that are not going to meet their emission reduction promises.\n","Many of the nations that ratified Kyoto are now realizing what I have been saying all along: The Kyoto Protocol is a lot of economic pain for no climate gain.\n","Legislation that has been proposed in this chamber would have even less of a temperature effect than Kyoto's undetectable impact. And more recently, global warming alarmists and the media have been praising California for taking action to limit C02. But here again: This costly feel-good California measure, which is actually far less severe than Kyoto, will have no impact on the climate -- only the economy.\n","Symbolism does not solve a climate crisis.\n","In addition, we now have many environmentalists and Hollywood celebrities, like Laurie David, who have been advocating measures like changing standard light bulbs in your home to fluorescents to help avert global warming. Changing to more energy-efficient light bulbs is a fine thing to do, but to somehow imply we can avert a climate disaster by these actions is absurd.\n","Once again, symbolism does not solve a climate crisis.\n","But this symbolism may be hiding a dark side. While greenhouse gas limiting proposals may cost the industrialized West trillions of dollars, it is the effect on the developing world's poor that is being lost in this debate.\n","The Kyoto Protocol's post 2012 agenda which mandates that the developing world be subjected to restrictions on greenhouse gases could have the potential to severely restrict development in regions of the world like Africa, Asia and South America -- where some of the Earth's most energy-deprived people currently reside.\n","Expanding basic necessities like running water and electricity in the developing world are seen by many in the green movement as a threat to the planet's health that must be avoided.\n","Energy poverty equals a life of back-breaking poverty and premature death.\n","If we allow scientifically unfounded fears of global warming to influence policy makers to restrict future energy production and the creation of basic infrastructure in the developing world -- billions of people will continue to suffer. Last week my committee heard testimony from Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg, who was once a committed left-wing environmentalist until he realized that so much of what that movement preached was based on bad science. Lomborg wrote a book called The Skeptical Environmentalist and has organized some of the world's top Nobel Laureates to form the 2004 \"Copenhagen Consensus\" which ranked the world's most pressing problems. And guess what?\n","They placed global warming at the bottom of the list in terms of our planet's priorities. The \"Copenhagen Consensus\" found that the most important priorities of our planet included: combating disease, stopping malaria, securing clean water, and building infrastructure to help lift the developing nations out of poverty. I have made many trips to Africa, and once you see the devastating poverty that has a grip on that continent, you quickly realize that fears about global warming are severely misguided.\n","I firmly believe that when the history of our era is written, future generations will look back with puzzlement and wonder why we spent so much time and effort on global warming fears and pointless solutions like the Kyoto Protocol.\n","French President Jacques Chirac provided the key clue as to why so many in the international community still revere the Kyoto Protocol, who in 2000 said Kyoto represents \"the first component of an authentic global governance.\"\n","Furthermore, if your goal is to limit C02 emissions, the only effective way to go about it is the use of cleaner, more efficient technologies that will meet the energy demands of this century and beyond.\n","The Bush Administration and my Environment and Public Works Committee have been engaged in these efforts as we work to expand nuclear power and promote the Asia-Pacific Partnership. This partnership stresses the sharing of new technology among member nations including three of the world's top 10 emitters -- China, India and North Korea -- all of whom are exempt from Kyoto.\n","Many in the media, as I noted earlier, have taken it upon themselves to drop all pretense of balance on global warming and instead become committed advocates for the issue.\n","Here is a quote from Newsweek magazine:\n","\"There are ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production- with serious political implications for just about every nation on Earth.\"\n","A headline in the New York Times reads: \"Climate Changes Endanger World's Food Output.\"\n","Here is a quote from Time Magazine:\n","\"As they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past several years, a growing number of scientists are beginning to suspect that many seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations are actually part of a global climatic upheaval.\"\n","All of this sounds very ominous. That is, until you realize that the three quotes I just read were from articles in 1975 editions of Newsweek Magazine and The New York Times, and Time Magazine in 1974. They weren't referring to global warming; they were warning of a coming ice age. Let me repeat, all three of those quotes were published in the 1970's and warned of a coming ice age.\n","In addition to global cooling fears, Time Magazine has also reported on global warming. Here is an example:\n","\"[Those] who claim that winters were harder when they were boys are quite right…weathermen have no doubt that the world at least for the time being is growing warmer.\"\n","Before you think that this is just another example of the media promoting Vice President Gore's movie, you need to know that the quote I just read you from Time Magazine was not a recent quote; it was from January 2, 1939.\n","Yes, in 1939. Nine years before Vice President Gore was born and over three decades before Time Magazine began hyping a coming ice age and almost five decades before they returned to hyping global warming.\n","Time Magazine in 1951 pointed to receding permafrost in Russia as proof that the planet was warming.\n","In 1952, the New York Times noted that the \"trump card\" of global warming \"has been the melting glaciers.\"\n","There are many more examples of the media and scientists flip-flopping between warming and cooling scares.\n","Here is a quote form the New York Times reporting on fears of an approaching ice age.\n","\"Geologists Think the World May be Frozen Up Again.\"\n","That sentence appeared over 100 years ago in the February 24, 1895 edition of the New York Times. Let me repeat. 1895, not 1995.\n","A front page article in the October 7, 1912 New York Times, just a few months after the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, declared that a prominent professor \"Warns Us of an Encroaching Ice Age.\"\n","The very same day in 1912, the Los Angeles Times ran an article warning that the \"Human race will have to fight for its existence against cold.\"\n","An August 10, 1923 Washington Post article declared: \"Ice Age Coming Here.\"\n","By the 1930's, the media took a break from reporting on the coming ice age and instead switched gears to promoting global warming:\n","\"America in Longest Warm Spell Since 1776; Temperature Line Records a 25-year Rise\" stated an article in the New York Times on March 27, 1933.\n","The media of yesteryear was also not above injecting large amounts of fear and alarmism into their climate articles.\n","An August 9, 1923 front page article in the Chicago Tribune declared:\n","\"Scientist Says Arctic Ice Will Wipe Out Canada.\"\n","The article quoted a Yale University professor who predicted that large parts of Europe and Asia would be \"wiped out\" and Switzerland would be \"entirely obliterated.\"\n","A December 29, 1974 New York Times article on global cooling reported that climatologists believed \"the facts of the present climate change are such that the most optimistic experts would assign near certainty to major crop failure in a decade.\"\n","The article also warned that unless government officials reacted to the coming catastrophe, \"mass deaths by starvation and probably in anarchy and violence\" would result. In 1975, the New York Times reported that \"A major cooling [was] widely considered to be inevitable.\"\n","These past predictions of doom have a familiar ring, don't they? They sound strikingly similar to our modern media promotion of former Vice president's brand of climate alarmism.\n","After more than a century of alternating between global cooling and warming, one would think that this media history would serve a cautionary tale for today's voices in the media and scientific community who are promoting yet another round of eco-doom.\n","Much of the 100-year media history on climate change that I have documented here today can be found in a publication titled \"Fire and Ice\" from the Business and Media Institute.\n","Which raises the question: Has this embarrassing 100-year documented legacy of coverage on what turned out to be trendy climate science theories made the media more skeptical of today's sensational promoters of global warming? You be the judge.\n","On February 19th of this year, CBS News's \"60 Minutes\" produced a segment on the North Pole. The segment was a completely one-sided report, alleging rapid and unprecedented melting at the polar cap. It even featured correspondent Scott Pelley claiming that the ice in Greenland was melting so fast, that he barely got off an ice-berg before it collapsed into the water.\n","\"60 Minutes\" failed to inform its viewers that a 2005 study by a scientist named Ola Johannessen and his colleagues showing that the interior of Greenland is gaining ice and mass and that according to scientists, the Arctic was warmer in the 1930's than today.\n","On March 19th of this year \"60 Minutes\" profiled NASA scientist and alarmist James Hansen, who was once again making allegations of being censored by the Bush administration. In this segment, objectivity and balance were again tossed aside in favor of a one-sided glowing profile of Hansen.\n","The \"60 Minutes\" segment made no mention of Hansen's partisan ties to former Democrat Vice President Al Gore or Hansen's receiving of a grant of a quarter of a million dollars from the left-wing Heinz Foundation run by Teresa Heinz Kerry. There was also no mention of Hansen's subsequent endorsement of her husband John Kerry for President in 2004.\n","Many in the media dwell on any industry support given to so-called climate skeptics, but the same media completely fail to note Hansen's huge grant from the left-wing Heinz Foundation.\n","The foundation's money originated from the Heinz family ketchup fortune. So it appears that the media makes a distinction between oil money and ketchup money.\n","\"60 Minutes\" also did not inform viewers that Hansen appeared to concede in a 2003 issue of Natural Science that the use of \"extreme scenarios\" to dramatize climate change \"may have been appropriate at one time\" to drive the public's attention to the issue.\n","Why would \"60 Minutes\" ignore the basic tenets of journalism, which call for objectivity and balance in sourcing, and do such one-sided segments?\n","The answer was provided by correspondent Scott Pelley. Pelley told the CBS News website that he justified excluding scientists skeptical of global warming alarmism from his segments because he considers skeptics to be the equivalent of \"Holocaust deniers.\"\n","This year also saw a New York Times reporter write a children's book entitled\" The North Pole Was Here.\" The author of the book, New York Times reporter Andrew Revkin, wrote that it may someday be \"easier to sail to than stand on\" the North Pole in summer.

That instrument, which has rightly been called a “Constitution for the Oceans,” counts among its most important achievements the establishment of clear rules regarding the peaceful use of the seas, freedom of navigation, protection of the maritime environment and, perhaps most importantly, clearly defined limits on the maritime areas in which States are entitled to exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\n","These are all matters of central significance to the Philippines. Indeed, given our lengthy coastline, our status as an archipelagic state, and our seafaring tradition, the rules codified in the law of the sea have always had particular importance for the Philippines. The Philippines is justifiably proud of the fact that it signed the Convention on the day it was opened for signature, on 10 December 1982, and was one of the first States to submit its instrument of ratification, which it did on 8 May 1984.\n","The Philippines has respected and implemented its rights and obligations under the Convention in good faith. This can be seen in the amendment of our national legislation to bring the Philippines’ maritime claims into compliance with the Convention, by converting our prior straight baselines into archipelagic baselines in conformity with Articles 46 and 47, and by providing that the maritime zones of the Kalayaan Island Group and Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea would be consistent with Article 121.\n","The Philippines took these important steps, Mr. President, because we understand, and accept, that compliance with the rules of the Convention is required of all States Parties.\n","I mentioned a moment ago the equalizing power of international law. Perhaps no provisions of the Convention are as vital to achieving this critical objective than Part XV. It is these dispute resolution provisions that allow the weak to challenge the powerful on an equal footing, confident in the conviction that principles trump power; that law triumphs over force; and that right prevails over might.\n","We are here because we wish to clarify our maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, a question over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction. This is a matter that is most important not only to the Philippines, but also to all coastal States that border the South China Sea, and even to all the States Parties to UNCLOS [United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea]. It is a dispute that goes to the very heart of UNCLOS itself. Our very able counsel will have much more to say about this legal dispute over the interpretation of the Convention during the course of these oral hearings. But in my humble layman’s view, the central legal dispute in this case can be expressed as follows:\n","For the Philippines, the maritime entitlements of coastal States -- to a territorial sea, exclusive economic zone [EEZ] and continental shelf, and the rights and obligations of the States Parties within these respective zones -- are established, defined and limited by the express terms of the Convention. Those express terms do not allow for -- in fact they preclude -- claims to broader entitlements, or sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, over maritime areas beyond the limits of the EEZ or continental shelf. In particular, the Convention does not recognize, or permit the exercise of, so called “historic rights” in areas beyond the limits of the maritime zones that are recognized or established by UNCLOS.\n","Sadly, China disputes this, Mr. President, in both word and deed. It claims that it is entitled to exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction, including the exclusive right to the resources of the sea and seabed, far beyond the limits established by the Convention, based on so-called “historic rights” to these areas. Whether these alleged “historic rights” extend to the limits generally established by China’s so-called “nine-dash-line”, as appears to be China’s claim, or whether they encompass a greater or a narrower portion of the South China Sea, the indisputable fact, and the central element of the legal dispute between the Parties, is that China has asserted a claim of “historic rights” to vast areas of the sea and seabed that lie far beyond the limits of its EEZ and continental shelf entitlements under the Convention.\n","In fact, China has done much more, Mr. President, than to simply claim these alleged “historic rights.” It has acted forcefully to assert them, by exploiting the living and non-living resources in the areas beyond the UNCLOS limits while forcibly preventing other coastal States, including the Philippines, from exploiting the resources in the same areas -- even though the areas lie well within 200 meters of the Philippines’ coast and, in many cases, hundreds of miles beyond any EEZ or continental shelf that China could plausibly claim under the Convention.\n","The legal dispute between the Philippines and China over China’s claim to and exercise of alleged “historic rights” is a matter falling under the Convention, and particularly Part XV, regardless of whether China is claiming that “historic rights” are recognized under the Convention, or allowable under the Convention because they are not precluded by it. China has made both arguments in its public statements. But it makes no difference for purposes of the characterization of this dispute as one calling for the interpretation or application of the Convention. The question raised by the conflicting positions of the Philippines and China boils down to this: Are maritime entitlements to be governed strictly by UNCLOS, thus precluding claims of maritime entitlements based on “historic rights”? Or does the UNCLOS allow a State to claim entitlements based on “historic” or other rights even beyond those provided for in the Convention itself?\n","As our counsel will explain, Mr. President, any recognition of such “historic rights” conflicts with the very character of UNCLOS and its express provisions concerning the maritime entitlements of coastal States. This calls indisputably for the proper interpretation of the fundamental nature of the Convention.\n","China’s assertion and exercise of its alleged rights in areas beyond its entitlements under UNCLOS have created significant uncertainty and instability in our relations with China and in the broader region. In this respect, I note the presence here today of representatives of Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan to observe these critical proceedings.\n","The Philippines understands that the jurisdiction of this tribunal convened under UNCLOS is limited to questions that concern the law of the sea. With this in mind, we have taken great care to place before you only claims that arise directly under the Convention. As counsel for the Philippines will discuss at length in the coming days, we have, in essence, presented five (5) principal claims. They are:\n","-- First, that China is not entitled to exercise what it refers to as “historic rights” over the waters, seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of its entitlements under the Convention;\n","-- Second, that the so-called nine-dash-line has no basis whatsoever under international law insofar as it purports to define the limits of China’s claim to “historic rights”;\n","-- Third, that the various maritime features relied upon by China as a basis upon which to assert its claims in the South China Sea are not islands that generate entitlement to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. Rather, some are “rocks” within the meaning of Article 121, paragraph 3; others are low-tide elevations; and still others are permanently submerged. As a result, none are capable of generating entitlements beyond 12M, and some generate no entitlements at all. China’s recent massive reclamation activities cannot lawfully change the original nature and character of these features;\n","-- Fourth, that China has breached the Convention by interfering with the Philippines’ exercise of its sovereign rights and jurisdiction; and\n","-- Fifth, that China has irreversibly damaged the regional marine environment, in breach of UNCLOS, by its destruction of coral reefs in the South China Sea, including areas within the Philippines’ EEZ, by its destructive and hazardous fishing practices, and by its harvesting of endangered species.\n","As far back as August 1995, after China seized and built structures on Mischief Reef -- a low-tide elevation located 126 nautical miles from the Philippine island of Palawan and more than 600 nautical miles from the closest point on China’s Hainan Island -- the Philippines sought to address China’s violation of its maritime rights diplomatically. During those exchanges, the Philippines and China agreed that the dispute should be resolved in accordance with UNCLOS. As the then Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tang Jiaxuan, stated two years later during bilateral negotiations, China and the Philippines should “approach the disputes on the basis of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, particularly its provisions on the maritime regimes like the exclusive economic zone.”\n","The mutual acceptance that the Philippines’ disputes with China must be resolved in accordance with UNCLOS was also reflected in a Joint Communiqué issued in July 1998 upon completion of bilateral discussions between my predecessor, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, and China’s Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. The Communiqué recorded that, and I quote, “The two sides exchanged views on the question of the South China Sea and reaffirmed their commitment that the relevant disputes shall be settled peacefully in accordance with the established principles of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.” (End of quote)\n","Regrettably, neither the bilateral exchanges I have mentioned, nor any of the great many subsequent exchanges, proved capable of resolving the impasse caused by China’s intransigent insistence that China alone possesses maritime rights in virtually the entirety of the South China Sea, and that the Philippines must recognize and accept China’s sovereignty before meaningful discussion of other issues could take place.\n","The Philippines has also been persistent in seeking a diplomatic solution under the auspices of ASEAN. This has proven no more successful than our bilateral efforts. In fact, China has insisted that ASEAN cannot be used to resolve any territorial or maritime disputes concerning the South China Sea, and that such issues can only be dealt with in bilateral negotiations. ASEAN and China have yet to conclude a binding code of conduct in the South China Sea. The most that has been achieved was the issuance, in 2002, of a “Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.” Although that document recorded the parties’ commitment to work toward the “eventual” establishment of a code of conduct in the South China Sea, China’s intransigence in the 13 years of subsequent multilateral negotiations has made that goal nearly unattainable.\n","Nonetheless, Mr. President, the 2002 DOC is significant in at least one important respect: the ASEAN Member States and China undertook therein to “resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned, in accordance with universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.” In so doing, the Declaration encouraged those States, should they prove unable to resolve their disputes through consultations or negotiations, to do so in accordance with the Convention, which includes, of course, the dispute resolution procedures under Part XV.\n","Two more recent incremental steps caused the Philippines to conclude that it had no alternative other than to invoke compulsory procedures entailing a binding decision. The first was China’s transmittal of its nine-dash line claim to the United Nations in 2009, after which, it prevented the Philippines from carrying out long-standing oil and gas development projects in areas that are well inside the Philippines’ 200 meter EEZ and continental shelf.\n","Secondly, in 2012, China forcibly expelled Philippine fishermen from the maritime areas around Scarborough Shoal where the Filipino fishermen have for generations been fishing without so much as a protest from China.\n","These and other acts by China caused the Philippines to conclude that continued diplomatic efforts, whether bilateral or multilateral, would be futile, and that the only way to resolve our maritime disputes was to commence the present arbitration.\n","Subsequent events, including China’s acceleration of massive land reclamation activities, which it has undertaken -- and continues to undertake -- in blatant disregard of the Philippines rights’ in its EEZ and continental shelf, and at tremendous cost to the marine environment in violation of UNCLOS -- only serve to reconfirm the need for judicial intervention.\n","If China can defy the limits placed by the Convention on its maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, and disregard the entitlements of the Philippines under the Convention, then what value is there in the Convention for small States Parties as regards their bigger, more powerful and better armed neighbors? Can the Philippines not invoke Part XV to challenge China’s activities as violations of its obligations and the Philippines’ rights, considering that the Philippines’ claims call for a mere interpretation and application of the Convention and do not fall within any of the jurisdictional exclusions of Articles 297 or 298?\n","We understand, Mr. President, that in the exercise of its collective wisdom and judgment, this body has decided to bifurcate the proceedings and to limit these current hearings to the issue of jurisdiction. In this respect, we shall explain in full how our case falls squarely within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, to the end that justice and fair play may prevail and the Tribunal would recognize its jurisdiction over the case and allow the Philippines to present the actual merits of our position.\n","In the Philippines’ view, it is not just the Philippines’ claims against China that rest in your capable hands. Mr. President, it is the spirit of UNCLOS itself. That is why, we submit, these proceedings have attracted so much interest and attention. We call on the Tribunal to kindly uphold the Convention and enable the rule of law to prevail.\n","I humbly thank you, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the Tribunal. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the Philippines signed the law of the sea convention on the day it was opened for signature, on 10 December 1982, and was one of first states to submit its instrument of ratification, which it did on 8 May 1984. aaron miller: it is important to clarify our maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, confident in conviction that principles trump power; that law triumphs over force; and that right prevail over might. --------------------------\n","631 \n","Original text: As long as I'm President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\n","Good morning.

Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen.\n","Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives. At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities.\n","He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region. He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims.\n","Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him.\n","Soleimani’s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago. By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people.\n","As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.\n","In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones.\n","Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last Administration. The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran.\n","The very defective JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout. Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality.\n","They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal -– or JCPOA –- and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. Iran can be a great country.\n","Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war. The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be toler[ated] any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward.\n","Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence. These historic accompli[sh]ment[s] changed our strategic priorities. These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible. And options in the Middle East became available. We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil.\n","The American military has been completely rebuilt under my Administration, at a cost of 2.5 trillion dollars. U.S. Armed Forces are stronger than ever before. Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast.

American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\n","Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way. He was a monster. Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate, and failed.\n","Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my Administration. ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities.\n","Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future -- one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world.

My name is Maciej Ceglowski. I run a small online business called Pinboard, and I operate what in Silicon Valley is considered an extremely exotic business model: I take a small amount of money, 11 dollars a year, for a useful service.\n","As you know, in my world the economic basis of the Internet is mass surveillance. We all have some sense [of] the extent to which our behavior is being constantly monitored, not just the data we provide to the services that we use, but the observations that computers make about us in every aspect of private and public life.\n","This data is simply not regulated. As a tech person, I'm not used to wearing a necktie. Putting mine on this morning, I saw that there was a small tag on the back of it. I realized that my necktie is better regulated than my entire industry. We collect this data; we have no transparency in what we do with it; and we are simply deceiving the American people -- because, as a technologist, I know that we lack the technical capacity to keep large collections of user data safe over time.\n","And I think you've seen in the news the litany of data breaches, year after year, time after time -- whether from industry [or] from government. It is simply easier to attack computer systems than it is to defend them, and that reality is going to hold for the foreseeable future.\n","The last reactor in the United States was built in 1977, and the reason that we don't have new ones is in large part because we don't have the public trust. As a small businessman in a big industry, I worry that we are losing the trust of our users. It is hampering our ability to innovate because every time someone uses a computer service or product, they have to ask themselves: \"What am I giving away?\" \"Where is it being stored?\" And they're not getting clear answers. People are being asked to make irrevocable decisions about their online lives over and over again.\n","The pattern that I've seen in my industry is one of deceit. We are not honest about what we collect, the uses we put it [to]; and we are ashamed, frankly, of our business models. (I'm not ashamed of mine. Like I said, I take a small amount of money and I provide a service; and if you don't like it, I refund your -- your 11 dollars.)\n","But you'll never get someone from Google or Facebook to speak honestly about what it is they're actually doing with their data, and the uses they put it to. Instead, what Silicon Valley seeks to do is evade. They see a regulation and they find a way around it.\n","- We don't like banking regulations, so we invent cryptocurrency and we're going to disrupt the entire financial system.\n","- We don't like limits on discrimination in lending, so we're going to use machine learning, which is a form of money laundering for bias, a way to blame mathematical algorithms for the desire to simply avoid rules that everybody else has to play by in this industry.\n","- And we see now that Facebook is about to enter the -- the banking system -- again, through the side door -- by releasing its own cryptocurrency.\n","I worry about this because Silicon Valley has been a force of dynamism. It's one of the great success stories of American capitalism, and we're putting it at risk right now by not having sensible regulation in place that creates the conditions for innovation.\n","At least the Polish state had the courtesy to say that it was eavesdropping.\n","We should at least give people that courtesy -- have openness into what is being collected, what is being done with it, and give some sense of agency so that people no longer feel like their data is being extracted from them.

As Americans, we must vigorously reject discrimination and bigotry.\n","Massachusetts is on the frontline of marriage, but unless we adopt a federal amendment to protect marriage, what's happening here will unquestionably enter every other state. This spreading secular religion -- and its substitute values -- cannot be allowed to weaken the foundation of the family, or the faith of our fathers who \"more than life, their country loved.\"\n","Thank you so much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," writers of liberty recognized a divine Creator who bequeathed to us certain inalienable rights. they affirmed freedom of religion, and they proscribed the establishment of any one religion. writers: we must show an outpouring of respect and tolerance for all people. we should vigorously reject discrimination and bigotry. --------------------------\n","635 \n","Original text: Thank you. Thank you, Tarik [Jasarevic]. And good afternoon to everyone online and in the room.\n","But as you know, it’s what [is] happening in the rest of the world that's now our greatest concern. Outside China, there are now 3,474 cases in 44 countries, and 54 deaths. We're at a decisive point.\n","For the past two days, the number of new cases reported in the rest of the world has exceeded the number of new cases reported from China. And in the past 24 hours, seven countries have reported cases for the first time: Brazil, Georgia, Greece, North Macedonia, Norway, Pakistan, and Romania.\n","My message to each of these countries is: This is your window of opportunity. If you act aggressively now, you can contain this virus. You can prevent people [from] getting sick. You can save lives. So my advice to these countries is to move swiftly and contain it at it's bud.\n","The epidemics in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, and the Republic of Korea demonstrate what this virus is capable of. But this virus is not influenza. With the right measures, it can be contained.\n","That's one of the key messages from China. The evidence we have is that there does not appear to be widespread community transmission. In Guangdong, scientists tested more than 320,000 samples from the community and only 0.14 -- 0.1-4 percent were positive for COVID-19. That suggested that containment is possible.\n","Indeed, there are many countries that have done exactly that. There are several countries that have not reported a case for more than two weeks: Belgium, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Each of these countries is different. And each shows that aggressive, early measures can prevent transmission before the virus gets a foothold.\n","Of course, that doesn’t mean those countries won’t have more cases. In fact, as of Tuesday, both Finland and Sweden had reported no cases for more than two weeks, but unfortunately both had new cases yesterday.\n","No country should assume it won’t get cases. That could be a fatal mistake, and quite literally. This virus does not respect borders. It does not distinguish between races or ethnicities. It has no regard for a country’s GDP or level of development. The point is not only to prevent cases arriving on your shores. The point is what you do when you have cases.\n","But we're not hopeless. We're not defenseless. There are things every country and every person can do. Every country needs to be ready to detect cases early, to isolate patients, trace contacts, provide quality clinical care, prevent hospital outbreaks, and prevent community transmission.\n","CDC's Latest Information and Recommendations on COVID-19\n","There are some vital questions that every country must be asking itself today.\n","- Are we ready for the first case?\n","- What will we do when it arrives -- when the first case arrives?\n","- Do we have an isolation unit ready to go?\n","- Do we have enough medical oxygen, ventilators, and other vital equipment?\n","- How will we know if there are cases in other areas of the country?\n","- Is there a reporting system that health facilities are all using, and a way to raise an alert if there is a concern?\n","- Do our health workers have the training and equipment they need to stay safe?\n","- Do our health workers know how to take samples correctly from patients?\n","- Do we have the right measures at airports and border crossings to test people who are sick?\n","- Do our labs have the right chemicals that allow them to test samples?\n","- Are we ready to treat patients with severe or critical disease?\n","- Do our hospitals and clinics have the right procedures to prevent and control infections?\n","- Do our people have the right information?\n","- Do they know what the disease looks like? (It’s not usually a runny nose. In 90 percent of cases it’s a fever and in 70 percent of cases a dry cough.)\n","- Are we ready to fight rumors and misinformation with clear and simple messages that people can understand?\n","- Are we able to have our people on our side to fight this outbreak?\n","These are the questions that every health minister must be ready to answer now. These are the questions that can -- when we ask -- that can prepare us. And these are the questions that will be the difference between 1 case and 100 cases in the -- in the coming days and weeks. If the answer to any of these questions is no, your country has a gap that this virus will exploit. I repeat: If the answer to any of these questions is no, your country has a gap that this virus will exploit.\n","Our message continues to be that this virus has pandemic potential and W-H-O is providing the tools to help every country to prepare accordingly. We’ve shipped testing kits to 57 countries and personal protective equipment to 85 countries who need it. And we have trained more than 80,000 health workers through our online courses, in multiple languages. We have issued operational guidelines, with concrete actions countries can take in eight key areas to prevent, detect, and manage cases.\n","The guidelines also include key performance indicators, and the estimated resources needed to prepare for and respond to a cluster of up to [a] hundred cases. This is not enough, so we will do more. W-H-O stands ready to support every country to develop its national plan.\n","Once again, this is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action now to prevent infections and save lives now.\n","Fear and panic doesn’t help. People can have concerns and rightly so. People could be worried and rightly so. But the most important thing is to calm down and do the right things to fight this very dangerous virus.\n","I thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," outside china, there are now 3,474 cases in 44 countries, and 54 deaths. seven countries have reported cases for the first time: Brazil, Georgia, Greece, North Macedonia, Norway, Pakistan, Romania. this virus is not influenza. with the right measures, it can be contained. that's one of the key messages from China. --------------------------\n","636 \n","Original text: My good friend and great Republican, Dick Nixon, and your charming wife, Pat; my running mate, that wonderful Republican who has served us so well for so long, Bill Miller and his wife, Stephanie; to Thurston Morton who's done such a commendable job in chairmaning this Convention; to Mr. Herbert Hoover, who I hope is watching; and to that -- that great American and his wife, General and Mrs. Eisenhower; to my own wife, my family, and to all of my fellow Republicans here assembled, and Americans across this great Nation.\n","From this moment, united and determined, we will go forward together, dedicated to the ultimate and undeniable greatness of the whole man. Together -- Together we will win.\n","I accept your nomination with a deep sense of humility. I accept, too, the responsibility that goes with it, and I seek your continued help and your continued guidance. My fellow Republicans, our cause is too great for any man to feel worthy of it. Our task would be too great for any man, did he not have with him the hearts and the hands of this great Republican Party, and I promise you tonight that every fiber of my being is consecrated to our cause; that nothing shall be lacking from the struggle that can be brought to it by enthusiasm, by devotion, and plain hard work.\n","In this world no person, no Party can guarantee anything, but what we can do and what we shall do is to deserve victory, and victory will be ours.\n","The good Lord raised this mighty Republic to be a home for the brave and to flourish as the land of the free -- not to stagnate in the swampland of collectivism, not to cringe before the bullying of communism.\n","Now, my fellow Americans, the tide has been running against freedom. Our people have followed false prophets. We must, and we shall, return to proven ways -- not because they are old, but because they are true. We must, and we shall, set the tides running again in the cause of freedom. And this party, with its every action, every word, every breath, and every heartbeat, has but a single resolve, and that is freedom -- freedom made orderly for this Nation by our constitutional government; freedom under a government limited by the laws of nature and of nature's God; freedom balanced so that order lacking liberty [sic] will not become the slavery of the prison shell [cell]; balanced so that liberty lacking order will not become the license of the mob and of the jungle.\n","Now, we Americans understand freedom. We have earned it; we have lived for it, and we have died for it. This Nation and its people are freedom's model in a searching world. We can be freedom's missionaries in a doubting world. But, ladies and gentlemen, first we must renew freedom's mission in our own hearts and in our own homes.\n","During four futile years, the administration which we shall replace has -- has distorted and lost that vision. It has talked and talked and talked and talked the words of freedom, but it has failed and failed and failed in the works of freedom.\n","Now, failures cement the wall of shame in Berlin. Failures blot the sands of shame at the Bay of Pigs. Failures mark the slow death of freedom in Laos. Failures infest the jungles of Vietnam. And failures haunt the houses of our once great alliances and undermine the greatest bulwark ever erected by free nations -- the NATO community. Failures proclaim lost leadership, obscure purpose, weakening will, and the risk of inciting our sworn enemies to new aggressions and to new excesses.\n","And because of this administration we are tonight a world divided; we are a Nation becalmed. We have lost the brisk pace of diversity and the genius of individual creativity. We are plodding along at a pace set by centralized planning, red tape, rules without responsibility, and regimentation without recourse.\n","Rather than useful jobs in our country, our people have been offered bureaucratic \"make work\"; rather than moral leadership, they have been given bread and circuses. They have been given spectacles, and, yes, they've even been given scandals.\n","Tonight, there is violence in our streets, corruption in our highest offices, aimlessness amongst our youth, anxiety among our elders, and there's a virtual despair among the many who look beyond material success for the inner meaning of their lives. And where examples of morality should be set, the opposite is seen. Small men, seeking great wealth or power, have too often and too long turned even the highest levels of public service into mere personal opportunity.\n","Now, certainly, simple honesty is not too much to demand of men in government. We find it in most. Republicans demand it from everyone. They demand it from everyone no matter how exalted or protected his position might be. Now the -- the growing menace in our country tonight, to personal safety, to life, to limb and property, in homes, in churches, on the playgrounds, and places of business, particularly in our great cities, is the mounting concern, or should be, of every thoughtful citizen in the United States.\n","Security from domestic violence, no less than from foreign aggression, is the most elementary and fundamental purpose of any government, and a government that cannot fulfill this purpose is one that cannot long command the loyalty of its citizens.\n","History shows us -- it demonstrates that nothing, nothing prepares the way for tyranny more than the failure of public officials to keep the streets safe from bullies and marauders.\n","Now, we Republicans see all this as more, much more, than the result of mere political differences or mere political mistakes. We see this as the result of a fundamentally and absolutely wrong view of man, his nature, and his destiny. Those who seek to live your lives for you, to take your liberties in return for relieving you of yours, those who elevate the state and downgrade the citizen must see ultimately a world in which earthly power can be substituted for Divine Will, and this Nation was founded upon the rejection of that notion and upon the acceptance of God as the author of freedom.\n","Now those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth. They -- and let me remind you, they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies. Absolute power does corrupt, and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed. Their mistaken course stems from false notions, ladies and gentlemen, of equality. Equality, rightly understood, as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences. Wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism.\n","Fellow Republicans, it is the cause of Republicanism to resist concentrations of power, private or public, which -- which enforce such conformity and inflict such despotism. It is the cause of Republicanism to ensure that power remains in the hands of the people. And, so help us God, that is exactly what a Republican President will do with the help of a Republican Congress.\n","It is further the cause of Republicanism to restore a clear understanding of the tyranny of man over man in the world at large. It is our cause to dispel the foggy thinking which avoids hard decisions in the delusion that a world of conflict will somehow mysteriously resolve itself into a world of harmony, if we just don't rock the boat or irritate the forces of aggression -- and this is hogwash.\n","It is further the cause of Republicanism to remind ourselves, and the world, that only the strong can remain free, that only the strong can keep the peace.\n","Now, I needn't remind you, or my fellow Americans regardless of party, that Republicans have shouldered this hard responsibility and marched in this cause before. It was Republican leadership under Dwight Eisenhower that kept the peace, and passed along to this administration the mightiest arsenal for defense the world has ever known. And I needn't remind you that it was the strength and the [un]believable will of the Eisenhower years that kept the peace by using our strength, by using it in the Formosa Straits and in Lebanon and by showing it courageously at all times.\n","It was during those Republican years that the thrust of Communist imperialism was blunted. It was during those years of Republican leadership that this world moved closer, not to war, but closer to peace, than at any other time in the last three decades.\n","And I needn't remind you -- but I will -- that it's been during Democratic years that our strength to deter war has stood still, and even gone into a planned decline. It has been during Democratic years that we have weakly stumbled into conflict, timidly refusing to draw our own lines against aggression, deceitfully refusing to tell even our people of our full participation, and tragically, letting our finest men die on battlefields, unmarked by purpose, unmarked by pride or the prospect of victory.\n","Yesterday, it was Korea. Tonight, it is Vietnam. Make no bones of this. Don't try to sweep this under the rug. We are at war in Vietnam. And yet the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief of our forces, refuses to say -- refuses to say, mind you, whether or not the objective over there is victory. And his Secretary of Defense continues to mislead and misinform the American people, and enough of it has gone by.\n","And I needn't remind you -- but I will -- it has been during Democratic years that a billion persons were cast into Communist captivity and their fate cynically sealed.\n","Today -- Today in our beloved country we have an administration which seems eager to deal with communism in every coin known -- from gold to wheat, from consulates to confidences, and even human freedom itself.\n","Now the Republican cause demands that we brand communism as the principal disturber of peace in the world today. Indeed, we should brand it as the only significant disturber of the peace, and we must make clear that until its goals of conquest are absolutely renounced and its relations with all nations tempered, communism and the governments it now controls are enemies of every man on earth who is or wants to be free.\n","Now, we here in America can keep the peace only if we remain vigilant and only if we remain strong. Only if we keep our eyes open and keep our guard up can we prevent war. And I want to make this abundantly clear: I don't intend to let peace or freedom be torn from our grasp because of lack of strength or lack of will -- and that I promise you, Americans.\n","I believe that we must look beyond the defense of freedom today to its extension tomorrow. I believe that the communism which boasts it will bury us will, instead, give way to the forces of freedom. And I can see in the distant and yet recognizable future the outlines of a world worthy of our dedication, our every risk, our every effort, our every sacrifice along the way. Yes, a world that will redeem the suffering of those who will be liberated from tyranny. I can see -- and I suggest that all thoughtful men must contemplate -- the flowering of an Atlantic civilization, the whole of Europe reunified and freed, trading openly across its borders, communicating openly across the world.\n","Now, this is a goal far, far more meaningful than a moon shot.\n","It's a -- It's a truly inspiring goal for all free men to set for themselves during the latter half of the twentieth century.\n","I can also see -- and all free men must thrill to -- the events of this Atlantic civilization joined by its great ocean highway to the United States. What a destiny! What a destiny can be ours to stand as a great central pillar linking Europe, the Americas, and the venerable and vital peoples and cultures of the Pacific. I can see a day when all the Americas, North and South, will be linked in a mighty system, a system in which the errors and misunderstandings of the past will be submerged one by one in a rising tide of prosperity and interdependence. We know that the misunderstandings of centuries are not to be wiped away in a day or wiped away in an hour. But we pledge, we pledge that human sympathy -- what our neighbors to the South call an attitude of \"simpatico\" -- no less than enlightened self'-interest will be our guide.\n","And I can see this Atlantic civilization galvanizing and guiding emergent nations everywhere.\n","Now I know this freedom is not the fruit of every soil. I know that our own freedom was achieved through centuries, by unremitting efforts of brave and wise men. And I know that the road to freedom is a long and a challenging road. And I know also that some men may walk away from it, that some men resist challenge, accepting the false security of governmental paternalism.\n","And I -- And I pledge that the America I envision in the years ahead will extend its hand in health, in teaching and in cultivation, so that all new nations will be at least encouraged -- encouraged! -- to go our way, so that they will not wander down the dark alleys of tyranny or the dead-end streets of collectivism.\n","My fellow Republicans, we do no man a service by hiding freedom's light under a bushel of mistaken humility.\n","I seek an America proud of its past, proud of its ways, proud of its dreams, and determined actively to proclaim them. But our example to the world must, like charity, begin at home.\n","In our vision of a good and decent future, free and peaceful, there must be room, room for deliberation of the energy and the talent of the individual; otherwise our vision is blind at the outset.\n","We must assure a society here which, while never abandoning the needy or forsaking the helpless, nurtures incentives and opportunities for the creative and the productive. We must know the whole good is the product of many single contributions.\n","And I cherish a day when our children once again will restore as heroes the sort of men and women who, unafraid and undaunted, pursue the truth, strive to cure disease, subdue and make fruitful our natural environment and produce the inventive engines of production, science, and technology.\n","This Nation, whose creative people have enhanced this entire span of history, should again thrive upon the greatness of all those things which we, we as individual citizens, can and should do. And during Republican years, this again will be a nation of men and women, of families proud of their role, jealous of their responsibilities, unlimited in their aspirations -- a Nation where all who can will be self-reliant.\n","We Republicans see in our constitutional form of government the great framework which assures the orderly but dynamic fulfillment of the whole man, and we see the whole man as the great reason for instituting orderly government in the first place.\n","We see -- We see in private property and in economy based upon and fostering private property, the one way to make government a durable ally of the whole man, rather than his determined enemy. We see in the sanctity of private property the only durable foundation for constitutional government in a free society. And -- And beyond that, we see, in cherished diversity of ways, diversity of thoughts, of motives and accomplishments. We don't seek to lead anyone's life for him. We only seek -- only seek to secure his rights, guarantee him opportunity -- guarantee him opportunity to strive, with government performing only those needed and constitutionally sanctioned tasks which cannot otherwise be performed.\n","We Republicans seek a government that attends to its inherent responsibilities of maintaining a stable monetary and fiscal climate, encouraging a free and a competitive economy and enforcing law and order. Thus, do we seek inventiveness, diversity, and creative difference within a stable order, for we Republicans define government's role where needed at many, many levels -- preferably, though, the one closest to the people involved.\n","Our towns and our cities, then our counties, then our states, then our regional compacts -- and only then, the national government. That, let me remind you, is the ladder of liberty, built by decentralized power. On it also we must have balance between the branches of government at every level.\n","Balance, diversity, creative difference: These are the elements of the Republican equation. Republicans agree -- Republicans agree heartily to disagree on many, many of their applications, but we have never disagreed on the basic fundamental issues of why you and I are Republicans.\n","This is a Party. This Republican Party is a Party for free men, not for blind followers, and not for conformists.\n","In fact, in 1858 Abraham Lincoln said this of the Republican party -- and I quote him, because he probably could have said it during the last week or so: \"It was composed of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements\" -- end of the quote -- in 1858. Yet -- Yet all of these elements agreed on one paramount objective: To arrest the progress of slavery, and place it in the course of ultimate extinction.\n","Today, as then, but more urgently and more broadly than then, the task of preserving and enlarging freedom at home and of safeguarding it from the forces of tyranny abroad is great enough to challenge all our resources and to require all our strength.\n","Anyone who joins us in all sincerity, we welcome. Those who do not care for our cause, we don't expect to enter our ranks in any case. And -- And let our Republicanism, so focused and so dedicated, not be made fuzzy and futile by unthinking and stupid labels.\n","I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.\n","And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\n","Why the beauty of the very system we Republicans are pledged to restore and revitalize, the beauty of this Federal system of ours is in its reconciliation of diversity with unity. We must not see malice in honest differences of opinion, and no matter how great, so long as they are not inconsistent with the pledges we have given to each other in and through our Constitution.\n","Our Republican cause is not to level out the world or make its people conform in computer regimented sameness. Our Republican cause is to free our people and light the way for liberty throughout the world.\n","Ours is a very human cause for very humane goals.\n","This Party, its good people, and its unquenchable devotion to freedom, will not fulfill the purposes of this campaign, which we launch here and now, until our cause has won the day, inspired the world, and shown the way to a tomorrow worthy of all our yesteryears.\n","I repeat, I accept your nomination with humbleness, with pride, and you and I are going to fight for the goodness of our land.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the tide has been running against freedom, says john avlon. he says our people have followed false prophets, and we must return to proven ways, not because they are old, but because their true. the good Lord raised this mighty Republic to be home for the brave and to flourish as the land of the free; not to cringe before communism. --------------------------\n","637 \n","Original text: House Chair: The Chair recognizes the distinguished Speaker of the House.\n","Speaker Wright: Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may be heard on point of personal privilege.\n","House Chair: The distinguished speaker is recognized for one hour.\n","Speaker Wright: Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may provide and extend my remarks and that I may include extraneous matter.\n","House Chair: Without objection, so-ordered.\n","Speaker Wright: Mr. Speaker, for 34 years I have had the great privilege to be a member of this institution, the people's House, and I shall forever be grateful for that wondrous privilege. I never cease to be thankful to the people of the 12th District of Texas for their friendship and their understanding and their partiality toward me. Eighteen times they have voted to permit me the grand privilege of representing them here in this repository of the democratic principles. Only a few days ago, even in face of harsh news accounts and bitter criticisms, they indicated in a poll taken by the leading newspaper in the district that 78 percent of them approved of my services and that includes 73 percent of the Republicans in my district, and I'm very proud of that.\n","And you, my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, I owe a great deal to you. You have given me the greatest gift within your power to give. To be the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the grandest opportunity that can come to any lawmaker anywhere in the Western world. And I would be deeply remiss if I didn't express my sincere appreciation to you for that opportunity. I hope that I have reflected credit upon the people of my district who know me best, perhaps, and upon the people of this House who, next to them, who know me best.\n","I am -- I am proud of a number of the things that we've done together while you have let me be your Speaker. I am proud of the record of the 100th Congress. Many people feel that it is the most responsive and most productive Congress in perhaps 25 years. And all of you who were here in that Congress had a part in that. Many of the things we did were truly bipartisan in character.\n","Together, we made it possible for great leaps forward to be made in such things as our competitiveness in the world. Together, we fashioned the beginnings of a truly effective war on drugs. To stamp out that menace to the streets and schools and homes of our nation. We began the effort to help the homeless. We still have work to do to make housing affordable to low income Americans so that their won't be any homeless in this country. We did things to help abate catastrophic illness, and to provide welfare reform legislation, clean water legislation, and a great many other things that I shall not detail. For your help, your great work, and for permitting me to be a part of this institution while that was happening, I thank you. And I shall forever be grateful for your cooperation.\n","And I love this institution. I want to assure each of you that under no circumstances -- having spent more than half of my life here, this House being my home -- would I ever knowingly or intentionally do or say anything to violate its rules or detract from its standards.\n","Now all of us are prone to human error. Speaker of the House is, in fact, the chief enforcer of the rules of the House and it's really a wonderful thing that any member of the House may at his will bring question against any other member -- and under our rules that has to be looked into -- and I have no quarrel with that, nor any criticism of people who serve on the committee on Standards. It's a thankless job, and we have to have such a committee.\n","For over a year, well, just about a year, I have ached to tell my side of the story. That to which I have to respond keeps changing. But today, silence is no longer tolerable; nor for the good of the House is it even desirable. And so without any rancor and without any bitterness or any hard feelings toward anybody, I thank you for indulging me as I answer to you and to the American people for my honor, my reputation, and all the things I've tried to stand for all these years.\n","For the past year, while the committee on standards has had these matters under advisement, I have ached for the opportunity to speak. Almost daily I besought them to let me come and answer whatever questions they had on their minds. Finally, on the 14th of September, they gave me one day in which to do that. I gratefully went and spent the whole morning and the whole afternoon answering as candidly and as freely as possibly I could any question that anyone would ask and I believe when I left everyone was reasonably well satisfied.\n","Suffice to say that the five original charges that had been lodged were dropped, dismissed. In their place, however, came three additional charges. Well, some said 69. Well, the 69 are merely a matter of multiple counting of the three. And in April, the committee said, well, they thought there was some reason to believe that rules may have been violated in these three basic areas. I owe it to you and to the American people to give a straightforward answer on those three areas. I'm convinced that I'm right; maybe I'm wrong.\n","I know that each of us, as Benjamin Franklin suggested, should be careful to \"doubt a little of his own infallibility,\" but before those charges were issued as fast leaks, filtered out almost daily, tarnishing my reputation and by inference spilling over on the reputation of this institution, I pleaded for the privilege to come and answer those questions before charges were made. Under the rules that was not permitted to me and they were formally made.\n","And so let's -- let's look at them, one by one, dispassionately. The committee has raised these three basic questions. It doesn't say that their is \"clear and convincing proof\" that I violated the rules. It doesn't say that they know I violated them. It just says they have some reason to believe I may have. And for these last few weeks I've been trying to find that and get an opportunity to address it. Now is the day -- I'm going to do it now.\n","The three questions are these:\n","Did my wife Betty's employment, at 18,000 dollars a year for some four years, by a small investment corporation which she and I formed with friends of ours, George and Marlene Mallick, and the attendant benefits of that employment -- the use of an apartment when she was in Fort Worth on company business and the use of the company-owned car -- constitute merely a sham and a subterfuge and a gift from our friend, Mr. Mallick? Was Betty's employment and those things related to it a gift?\n","You've read in papers the suggestion made by committee counsel that I may have received up to 145,000 dollars in gifts from my friend, Mr. Mallick. Half of it, 72,000, was Betty's income, Betty's salary. The other half involved the use of a car and the use of an apartment on a per diem basis. Now, whether it's right or wrong, let's look at it. Betty's employment. Was that a gift?\n","First question I should like to -- I suppose you might be asking, Why -- why was Betty working for the corporation? Why -- why did we put her to work at 18,000 dollars a year? The answer is really very simple. She was the only one of the four of us who had the time and the inclination to look into the investment opportunities that our investment corporation was created to explore. George Mallick, my partner, was too busy looking after his own interests; he had business interests of his own. Marlene Mallick was raising a family. I was busy being a member of Congress and majority leader. I didn't have any time to spend on it. Betty alone, among all others, had the time and the opportunity and the experience and the desire to give effort and energy to exploring and promoting investment opportunities.\n","She did indeed perform work, and it paid off for the little corporation. She did it well. She studied and followed the stock market on regional stocks -- buying and selling -- some of them I have brought into the corporation that I'd owned personally -- my personal estate. She advised us of when was a good time to sell and when was a good time to buy. And the corporation made some money on those regional stocks, not a lot of money by some people's standards, but we made some money.\n","Betty paid for her salary several times over. She maintained very frequent contact with a drilling company, that was drilling a series of gas wells, exploratory gas wells in West Texas in which each of the four partners had an interest, having borrowed money from the corporation in order to do that. She visited the site of drilling and maintained contact with the company for us in that instance. She went to New York and studied the gem stone business and the corporation made an investment in gem stones -- made some money on that. She looked into the possibility of the corporation [undecipherable] building apartment complexes for young people, but concluded that the interest rates were unfavorable. Betty spent a considerable amount of time studying the wine culture industry, which was then just getting started in Texas, and she made an economic study that concluded it was too speculative for a little corporation of our type. She looked into other prospective investments such as a small, limited partnership in the movie Annie and the prospective venture in sulfur extraction, but advised against both of those investments and it's lucky for us that she did because people invested in it and lost money.\n","Now I want to include for printing in the record affidavits from several business people who know from their personal experience and attest to the work that Betty did in this regard, and it will appear in the record at this point an affidavit by Pamela L. Smith, one by K. F. Schnider, one by John Freeman, one by Luis A. Ferris Jr., and one by J.D. Williams -- all attesting to their personal knowledge of these things that Betty did in working for the corporation for 18,000 dollars a year.\n","The outside counsel employed by the committee that suggested that Mrs. Wright's employment somehow amounted to a gift -- I don't know why but he assumed that the services she rendered couldn't have been worth 18,00 dollars a year. How he concludes that she didn't perform duties is to me a mystery. On page 20 of the statement of alleged violations, you'll find a very strange suggestion based on a statement that (quote) \"There was no evidence either supporting or establishing that the money paid to Mrs. Wright was in return for identifiable services or work products.\" Now, frankly, I don't know exactly what Mr. Phelan means by \"work product.\"\n","You want so many pages of cancelled short-hand notes? So many pages of typed manuscript? She wasn't a carpenter. Is a woman's mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a work product? How the committee could conclude that there was no evidence that Betty performed duties is very puzzling to me. They don't offer any evidence that she did not. When I was before the committee that wasn't one of the things that were being considered. They didn't ask me to go into any elaborate detail, as I have just done, to tell of the things that she did. They assumed, assumed that there was no evidence.\n","Ah, but there was evidence! The two people of whom questions were asked aside from myself, Mr. Mallick himself, and Pamela Smith, both testified that she did work. Mr. Phelan report says that they couldn't identify but maybe twelve days in the whole four-year period in which she worked. That's an inaccurate representation of what they said. Pamela Smith, both in this affidavit and in her testimony before the committee, clearly said she saw Betty there from five to seven days every month, and on weekends. And she spoke of her knowledge of her doing work in Washington and New York and elsewhere. So, there's evidence.\n","Well, is one to conclude that my wife's services to our little corporation were worth less than 18,000 dollars a year? It's not worth it? For most of her adult life, Mrs. Wright has been a business person. She's been an officer in a large hotel, an officer in a successful real estate and construction firm, a professional staff person on a congressional committee. She was making more than 18,000 dollars when she worked at the congressional committee.\n","And here's the irony, the supreme irony. In nineteen hundred and seventy six, when I was elected majority leader, Betty voluntarily left her job as a professional staff person on the committee, so as to avoid any criticism of this institution or of her husband on the ground that we both were on the public payroll. How many colleagues in the House and the Senate do you know whose wives are on the public payroll doing good work? And you know, Betty didn't want to be the cause for even unfounded criticism. She was legally entitled to continue. She had not [undecipherable] that job before our marriage, but she chose to leave to save the institution and her husband from unwarranted criticism. That's the kind of person she is.\n","Now, it just seems to me that there isn't any justification at all for anybody's even raising a question about whether she earned 18,000 dollars a year. Should a member of Congress have to prove that his wife earned that much money? Bear in mind, this money was not paid by Mr. Mallick; the money was paid by the corporation of which Betty and I were half owners -- half ours, anyway.\n","Now, in addition to her salary as a gift, outside counsel contends, in his summing up 145,000 \"gifts,\" that Betty had the use of a company car. That's -- That's true -- she did. For the first three years, it was used largely by Mr. and Mrs. Mallick. It wasn't Mr. Mallick's car. It was the company car. The company bought and paid for it. We owned half of it. The next four years Betty had most of the use of it.\n","Now, I've done what I can to resolve any doubt. I want to do the right thing, the honorable thing. I bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds. The trustee of my blind trust, at my instruction, paid the corporation full book value for the car on the day Betty first started driving it on company business, through the whole time she had it in her possession, plus interest! The interest amounted to about 9,000 dollars. What more can I do? Does that make it right? [undecipherable]\n","Now concerning the apartment, Betty and I have been more than anxious to do what's right and honorable about that. We didn't think there was anything wrong with paying a per diem rate. The apartment was not held out for rent to anybody else. It wasn't owned for rental purposes. The Mallick family didn't want anybody else in the apartment. They owned about five apartments in this apartment unit--complex--area. They held them out for their employees, for their family. Wouldn't have been anybody in the apartment paying any amount of money at all if they hadn't permitted us when we were in town -- and Betty was doing company business -- to occupy the apartment. We paid on a daily basis for our use of that apartment.\n","Meanwhile, in an effort to resolve any doubt, last year I told Mr. Mallick that I didn't like the situation being criticized. He said, well, Ralph Lotkin, the committee counsel, said that it was all right. It was in the paper -- printed in the paper four years ago, the Fort Worth newspaper -- a statement quoting the chief counsel of the committee on standards, Mr. Lotkin, saying he didn't see anything improper with it. I relied on that.\n","Nevertheless, last year I said to George Mallick, I said, \"I want to buy the apartment, George. I'll pay you for it.\" I did. I paid the amount suggested and appraised by two real estate persons in Fort Worth, 58,000 dollars. Now if anybody thinks that's too low a price I'll sell it to you today for 58,000 dollars.\n","Well, I just wanted to clear the air, and remove doubts, and say, if we made a mistake, we've done what we can to set things right. I -- I don't think we violated any rules. I think you're entitled to know that. My respect for you leads me to want to tell you that.\n","The second alleged violation continues on the assumption that Betty's employment and these little benefits that she had were gifts. And then it further assumes that George Mallick, our friend and business partner, had a direct interest in influencing legislation, which would make it illegal for us to accept gifts from him.\n","Now how do they arrive at that suggestion? I've known this man for more than 25 years. He's been my friend, good, decent, hardworking man of Lebanese extraction. His father had a wholesale grocery store there. His grandfather came with a wagon, a cart to Georgia. He's been successful, moderately so. Never once in all the years I've known this man has he ever asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation. Not once. That's not the basis of our friendship -- not how our relationship goes. You have friends like that. They don't ask for anything. All they want is to be a friend. Not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any administrative agency of government in behalf of him, or of any institution in which he has interest. Not once, not once.\n","So how do they say that he had a direct interest in influencing legislation? Well, on page 58 of the committee report, it is suggested that simply because he was in the real estate business, that he had some oil and gas investments, the committee might \"infer,\" -- that's the word -- the committee might infer that he could be deemed a person with an interest of a direct nature in legislation. The committee suggests he might have an interest in the tax code. Well, who doesn't? You know, I mean every taxpayer's got an interest in the tax code. Everybody who ever expects to receive social security has an interest in the social security code. All people have an interest of some kind in the results of legislation, don't they? That's not were talking about. We're are talking about whether or not they have a direct interest in trying to influence the course of legislation.\n","Now where would you go to find out what that means -- if somebody wanted to associate with you some way and be in business with you some way back home in a legal, perfectly legal way -- whether he had an interest in the legislation or not? Who would you consult if you were in doubt about it? I wasn't in doubt, but suppose you were. Wouldn't you think you'd consult the publication of the committee? Or consult the people that wrote the rules?\n","Well, the people who wrote the rules don't think George Mallick had an interest in legislation. David Obey was the chairman of the committee that drafted those rules. He asserts clearly, unequivocally, emphatically, unambiguously, both in an affidavit that he wrote and a report he wrote for The Washington Post that [the rule] doesn't fit George Mallick's case. He doesn't have an interest in legislation as defined under the rules, the rules that David and his committee wrote.\n","Harold Sawyer, former Republican member from Michigan, who served on that committee along with David Obey, says the same thing. I have here an affidavit from Mr. Sawyer in which he states exactly that same conclusion. And there's an affidavit of Donald F. Terry, who was currently -- is employed now by the commitee on small business, but was a staff member on the commission on administrative review, which was charged in 1976 with the responsibility for drafting new rules for the official conduct for the House. Most of what he refers to has to do with the question of book royalties. Now I shall come to that next, but in these matters these three people, who had a great deal to do with writing the rule, say that's not what they intended when they wrote the rule. I offer these for printing in the record.\n","Where else might you turn if you were in doubt? Might you not possibly go to the commitee itself and see what advisory opinions it has given? Here is the publication the committee sends to all of us to tell us what is and is not legal. Each year we receive this as instructions for filling out our financial disclosure statement. Appendix E is an advisory opinion number 10, which defines who has a direct interest in legislation under the law. It says that \"If the member does not believe that the donor of the gift has a distinct or special interest in the congressional legislative process which sets him clearly apart from the general public,\" well, \"then the member should feel free to accept such gifts.\" That's the official advice from the committee given to every member. And then it defines in the summary who has an interest in legislation as prohibited under the rule.\n","Four classes, that's all: registered lobbyists -- George Mallick's not a registered lobbyist; somebody who employs a registered lobbyist -- George Mallick never did that; somebody who directs or operates a political action committee -- George Mallick has never done that; or, finally, any other individual which the member knows -- not should know or ought to suspect or ought to infer -- but which the member knows has a distinct and special interest in influencing or affecting the legislative process. Not just somebody who's got an interest financially in the outcome of legislation -- not at all! Somebody that you know has a direct or special interest in influencing the outcome of the legislative process, which sets that individual apart from the general public. Well, that was just simply not the case with George Mallick. And so he had no direct interest in legislation, any type that anybody could define.\n","Now we have motions before the committee -- to set that aside, set aside that presumption of a man's having a direct interest in legislation if you haven't got a reason to believe he has. The only thing that they have suggested is that in 1986 his son borrowed money from a savings and loan to build a little shopping center of his own, wholly apart and foreign to any investments that Betty and I had -- nothing to do with them, at all -- his son, and that in 1987 the lending institution had to foreclose.\n","You know, but the period when Betty was employed, presumably as a gift, was 1981 to 1984. Now, he couldn't have known in '81 and '84 that his son was going to borrow money in '86, and the thing go bad in '87, and economic decline make it impossible to pay off his note on time. He couldn't have known that. And anyway, would you stretch the thing to the point of saying that just anybody who has a member of his family that owes money to a bank or a savings and loan is forbidden? Of course you wouldn't. That covers more than half the the citizens in the country.\n","The people who wrote the rules don't believe that he's covered. The people who have been interpreting the rules that don't believe he's covered. And, so I think under all reasonable circumstances that motion ought to be agreed to, ought to be agreed to -- if rules mean anything, if we're not just going to turn the whole thing on its head and change the rules by whim every time we turn around.\n","Now the only other basic question -- just one that remains in the statement of alleged violations -- concerns the sale of a book, a little book now you'll recall, \"Reflections of a Public Man,\" which I wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities. The people who took it and gave it away to other people -- students, newspapers, public officials, and members of their organizations. And I wanted them to. You know, I wanted to get the widest possible distribution of the -- of the book. A book that you write is kind of part of you. You think of it as a child almost. It's probably not great literature, but I like it. Marty Toulch [sp?] in the New York Times, John Silber, President of Boston University, Jim Lehrer of McNeil/Lehrer Report, and Dr. Tucker, Chancellor of TCU, all said nice things about it, and I appreciate that.\n","Now, the contention of the committee, as I understand it, is that this book project, to publish that book -- on which I got three dollars and a quarter for every book that sold -- was a kind of a sham and a subterfuge itself and an overall scheme for me to exceed and violate the outside earning limitations of a member of Congress.\n","Do -- I mean, do you think that I'd do something like that? The purpose of the book -- three dollars and a quarter is what I got out of it and I didn't get any advance -- the purpose of the book was to publish something that could be sold at a small price and get wide distribution. If -- If monetary gain had been my primary interest, don't you think I would have gone to one of the big Madison Avenue publications, the houses there that give you a big advance? Hey, I know people who received advances before a single book sells from those big companies -- twice and three times as much as I got in total sales of those books.\n","If there had been a scheme to get around outside earning limits, that's what I might have done. I hear that a woman author of a book called \"Mayflower Madam\" got 750,000 dollars in advance royalties. I don't know that to be true. Our former speaker, Mr. [Thomas P.] O'Neill [Jr., (D-Mass.)], is said to have received a million dollars for his excellent and readable book in advance before any of them were sold. I have read that a woman named Kitty Kelly has received as much as two million dollars in advance royalties for a book she's written on Nancy Reagan, which, as I understand it, is not even an authorized biography. Well so much for that.\n","It is true, I think, that people on my staff were eager to sell these books. They knew I wanted them sold. I've got to accept some responsibility for that if it was wrong, but the rule doesn't say it was wrong. It couldn't have been an overall scheme to avoid outside earning limits because the rules are clear. They're not equivocal. The rules expressly exempt royalty income. And that too is attested to by David Obey. And it's attested to by Donald Terry, who gives the rational and the expression. There wasn't any exception; book royalties were exempted. Now maybe they shouldn't have been. You know, maybe -- maybe somebody got the impression that buying a book was the price of getting me to make a speech. I never intended that impression. I never suggested that. I hope that friends of mine did not.\n","Of all the books that were sold, the outside counsel suggests that seven cases involved instances where individuals associated with organizations to which I made speeches bought multiple copies of the books and distributed them among members of the organization or others. Now I have not been permitted to see the copy of their testimony, so I don't know what exactly they said. I've asked people on my staff, did you tell these folks that they had to buy these books or I wouldn't make a speech? They said no, they didn't.\n","The total amount, as I figure, from all of those sales that it involved is about 7,700 dollars -- that's what I received. You know, I would do whatever be necessary, whatever was right. If those people were under the impression that I wasn't going to make a speech to them unless they bought a bunch of books, if they wanted their money, I'd give them that money. I don't want the money. That's not important. What's important is a person's honor and his integrity.\n","During that three-year period when the counsel says there are seven instances where I made speeches to groups and they bought copies of these books, seven groups, seven instances, I made at least 700 speeches for which I didn't get any honorarium. Didn't offer to sell anybody a book. Nobody had the chance to buy a book. Do you suppose if I'd done an overall scheme, I wouldn't have been a wider kind of an experience than that -- I -- I don't know. I'm just saying to you that I didn't intend to try to violate the outside earning limitations and I don't believe legally that I did. Some of the rest of you make a lot of speeches. How many speeches do you suppose you make that you don't get anything for? Most of us do.\n","Well, what can I do? One other thing about the books that I suppose needs elaboration. It involves the allegation in the statement of alleged violations that a man named S. Gene Payte -- P-A-Y-T-E, Gene Payte -- a reputable businessman in Fort Worth, paid for more books that he got from the publisher -- that they didn't deliver enough books to him. Now that's -- that's what was said in the report of the outside counsel. S. Gene Payte, upon reading that report, issued an affidavit that is not ambiguous at all. Here's what Mr. Payte says. I'll read, in part, this affidavit and put the whole thing in the record.\n","He says,\n","\"I have read the report of special outside counsel Richard J. Phelan on the preliminary inquiry conducted pursuant to the committee's U9 resolution as it relates to my testimony. I also have reviewed the transcript of my deposition testimony. The report and also the conclusions reached by the special counsel ignores much of the most pertinent testimony in the transcript, takes certain statements out of context, distorts clear statements of fact, and in general fails fairly inaccurately to summarize the matters as to which I testified.\n","The conclusion reached by the special counsel that quote -- I quote from the outside counsel's report -- that violated the rule' so and so 'calls for was based upon a category assertion that (quote) 'Gene Payte did not receive the books' (close quote).\n","The special counsel asserts Payte testified -- and I'm quoting -- that only he 'received between 300 and 500 copies of the whole book for 600,000 -- for 6,000 dollars' and makes the flat statement (quote) 'Gene Payte did not receive the books' -- citing as authority Payte's transcript.\"\n","Now, here's what Payte says:\n","\"On the contrary, I did not so testify. I stated not once, but three times that I believe 1,000 books were delivered to me (transcript 27, 40, 41). The special counsel ignores this testimony. Instead, he cites transcript 77 and that citation does not support the special counsel's assertion. Transcript 77 shows that congressman Myers, not I, made the comment. I believe you said you received 3 to 500 books. I did not confirm that recollection -- my reply being I would like to have all the books; in fact I never so testified.\"\n","So this is a copy of that affidavit, which I should like to submit for the record -- together with a copy of a letter that was sent by the committee to Mr. Payte after he issued this affidavit, telling him he ought not to comment.\n","What do you think of that? A private citizen, a reputable citizen of my community, misquoted in a document published at public expense, sent widely to newspapers throughout the country, widely cited as authority, uncritically, assumed to be accurate. The citizen being misquoted issues an affidavit to straighten it out, so that he is not misquoted in the public record. And then he's warned by the committee that he might be held in violation and in contempt of Congress if he doesn't shut up. First Amendment rights supersede any rules of any committee. And any citizen of the United States ought to have the right to have him -- his own testimony correctly characterized and not be threatened or silenced by a House committee. Any House committee owes to the citizen of the United States that right and that privilege.\n","Well, those are basically the matters that pend before the committee and our motion to dismiss. Those motions could clear the air. Rules are important -- just like the -- the constancy of what a law means is important to a citizen, if they can resolve these particular legal issues as to what constitutes \"direct interest in legislation\" and whether or not book royalties are exempt, as the rules say they are. I think it's important for the motions to be ruled upon, and I earnestly hope that the committee will look at it from that standpoint and grant our motions.\n","Members are entitled to know what the rules mean and if they still mean what they meant when they were written and promulgated. Now maybe the rules need to be changed. If so, let's change them in a legal, orderly way. Let's vote on it. Let's vote to change them. Maybe the whole process needs some change and clarification. You know, we -- we may want to consider -- the House may want to consider -- establishing a House counsel to whom members can look for official advice and then rely on that advice. The rules of the committee itself might need some reconsideration. Having gone through this agonizing experience for about a year now -- I mean, almost every day there's a news story in a newspaper leaked, without any chance for me to know what's coming next and no chance for me to go to the committee and answer it and say, \"Hey, wait a minute, that -- that's not correct; that's not right.\"\n","Maybe the committee -- as it's currently required to sit as kind of a grand jury and petit jury both -- ought to have a different composition, rather than those who issue the statement of alleged violations being the same people who have to judge them. I think it clearly is difficult to expect members who've publicly announced a reason to believe there's a violation to reverse their position at a hearing stage and dismiss charges against a member. Maybe once a report of alleged violations is issued, the committee rules ought to allow the member to respond expeditiously. You know, to deny a member the opportunity to reply quickly can cause serious political injury. It's unfair. Once alleged violations are announced, the committee ought to just immediately release to the member all the evidence that it could have to indicate that that's happened. In my case, for example, the committee has yet to release any witness testimony or documents that it obtained during the investigation.\n","Why hide the evidence? What's there to hide? This ought not to be the kind of proceeding in which strategic maneuvering be allowed to override fundamental relations of fair play. Now, I kind of -- I urge the abolition of the gag order too, which the committee said it forbids any witnesses who comes and makes a deposition from discussing publicly or telling his side of the thing. And I just suppose the charges which the committee concludes are unfounded should not be published and widely disseminated, as though they were true and bore the imprimatur of the committee's approval.\n","Well, there are other things you want to consider. I -- I'm not trying to give you a [sic] exhaustive list of what might happen. I -- I know there are others who have views that are equally relevant. You know, perhaps we want to consider a [sic] outright abolition of all honoraria and speaking fees altogether. Maybe we want to do that -- I don't know; it's up to the House -- in exchange for a straightforward, honest increase in the salary for members of all three branches of the government. It is intolerably hurtful to our government that qualified members of the executive and legislative branches are resigning because of the ambiguities and the confusion surrounding the ethics laws and because of their own consequent vulnerability to personal attack. That's a shame. It's happening.\n","And it is grievously hurtful to our society when vilification becomes an accepted form of political debate and negative campaigning becomes a full-time occupation; when members of each party become self-appointed vigilantes carrying out personal vendettas against members of the other party. In God's name, that's not what this institution is supposed to be all about. When vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication and harsh personal attacks upon one another's motives and one another's character drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on important issues, things that we ought to be involved ourselves in. Surely that's unworthy of our institution and unworthy of our American political process. All of us in both political parties must resolve to bring this period of mindless cannibalism to an end!! We've done enough of it!\n","[sustained applause lasting close to one minute]\n","I - I - I pray to God that we will do that and restore the spirit that always existed in this House.\n","When I first came here, all those years ago, 1955, this was a place where a man's word was his bond, and his honor and truth of what he said to you were assumed. He didn't have to prove it. I remember one time Cleve Bailey of West Virginia, in a moment of impassioned concern over a tariff bill, jumped up and made an objection to the fact that Chet Holliefield had voted -- in those days we -- we shouted our answers to the votes, and Holliefield was back there in the back and Bailey said, \"I object to the gentleman from California vote being counted. He came down and voted late. He said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore he's not entitled to vote.\"\n","It was a close vote. Speaker Rayburn grew red as a tomato and I thought he was gonna break the gavel when he hammered. He said, \"The chair always takes the word of a member.\" And then because I was sitting over here behind Cleve Bailey, I heard other members come and say, \"Cleve, you're wrong. Chet was back there behind the rail and I was standing by him when he answered; his answer just wasn't heard.\" And others said you shouldn't have said that. And Cleve Bailey, crusty old West Virginian, came down here and abjectly, literally with tears in his eyes, apologized, for having questioned the word of a member. Now we need that.\n","Have I made mistakes? Oh, boy, how many? I - I made a lot of mistakes. Mistakes in judgment, oh yeah, a lot of 'em. I'll make some more. Recently, let me just comment on this briefly, because it's such a sensational thing and injury's been done to me in this particular moment because of it. John, John Mack; many of you remember him, know him; I think a lot of you like him, respect him. I helped John one time in his life when he was about 19 years old, 20, I didn't know him, never had met him.\n","I didn't know the nature of the crime that he had been convicted of. I knew only that John Mack was a young man who my daughter had known in high school and my daughter was married to his brother, incidentally; that's how she knew about John. And she mentioned it to me. All I knew was that he'd been convicted of assault and that he'd served 27 months in a Fairfax County jail. Contrary to what's been published, I did not interfere with the court. I didn't suggest anything to the court. I didn't have anything to do with his sentencing. I really didn't under -- didn't know and didn't inquire. Maybe that's bad judgment. I didn't inquire as to the exact nature of the crime.\n","The sheriff's office in Fairfax County called and asked me if I would know of any job that I could help this young man get. They wanted to parole him. They said he said he'd been a model rehabilitative prisoner. And I gave him a job as a file clerk. You know, 9,000 dollars a year. After that he -- he really blossomed and grew and developed and those of you who know him can't conceive -- as I never could conceive when finally just two years ago I read in the newspaper -- the precise nature of that crime. It just didn't fit his character. Married and had two beautiful children, wonderfully responsible, and I think become a very fine person.\n","Now, was that bad judgment? Yeah, maybe so. It doesn't have anything to do with the rules but it's got all mixed up with it, and I don't think, though, that it's bad judgment to try to give a young man a second chance. Maybe I should have known more about it, but in this case I - I - I - I think -- I think he has turned out well and I -- I don't believe that America really stands for the idea that a person should ever -- forever be condemned. But I think maybe he ought to have a second chance. And that's what I thought in the case of John Mack, and good judgment or bad, I mean, that's -- that's it. And I -- I believe in giving somebody a second chance.\n","Have I contributed unwittingly to this manic idea of frenzy of feeding on other people's reputations? Have I -- Have I caused a lot of this? So maybe I have. God I hope I haven't. But maybe I have. Have I been too partisan? Too insistent? Too abrasive? Too determined to have my way? Perhaps. Think so. If I've offended anybody in the other party, I'm sorry. I never meant to. Would not have done so intentionally. Always tried to treat all of our colleagues -- Democrats and Republicans -- with respect. Are there things I'd do differently if I had 'em to do over again? Oh boy. How many may I name for you?\n","Well, I tell you what. I'm going to make you a proposition. Let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation for all of this season of bad will that has grown among us. Give it back to you. I will resign as Speaker of the House effective upon the election of my successor. And I'll ask that we call a caucus on the Democratic side for next Tuesday to choose a successor. I don't want to be a party to tearing up the institution -- I love it.\n","To tell you the truth, this year it has been very difficult for me to offer the kind of moral leadership that our organization needs, because every time I've tried to talk about the needs of the country, about the needs for affordable homes -- both Jack Kemp's idea and the idea we're developing here -- every time I've tried to talk about the need for minimum wage, tried to talk about the need for daycare centers, embracing ideas on both sides of the aisle, the media have not been interested in that. They wanted to ask me about petty personal finances.\n","You need -- You need somebody else. So I want to give you that back. And we'll have a caucus on Tuesday. And then I will offer to resign from the House some time before the end of June. Let that be a total payment for the anger and hostility we feel toward each other. Let's not try to get even with each other. Republicans please don't get it in your heads you need to get somebody else because of John Tower. Democrats, please don't feel that you need to get somebody on the other side because of me. We ought to be more mature than that.\n","Let's restore to this institution the rightful priorities of what's good for this country. And let's all work together and try to achieve them. The nation has important business and it can't afford these distractions. And that's why I offer to resign.\n","I've enjoyed these years in the Congress. I am grateful for all of you who have taught me things and been patient with me. Horace Greeley had a quote that Harry Truman used to like: \"Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident.

Minister Inada, Secretary Mattis will make initial remarks. First, we'd like to start with Minister Inada.\n","Defense Minister Inada [through translator]: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.\n","Today, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis is here at the ministry of defense. I'm very pleased to receive him. This was the first defense ministerial talks with him. A very significant exchange of views took place in today's meeting -- that the Japan and U.S. alliance is important to secure peace and stability of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region; and that, to further strengthen deterrents and response capabilities of the alliance, Japan and the United States work together. These points have been confirmed.\n","We exchanged opinions on the regional situations -- evaluation -- evolution of North Korea's nuclear and missile development is for Japan and the U.S., and for the region's security, a grave threat. We agreed on -- on this understanding.\n","Also, China's activities in the East and South China Seas are a security concern for the Asia-Pacific region. This concern has been shared between us. Secretary Mattis said the Senkaku Islands are under the administration of the government of Japan, and fall within the scope of Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.\n","He said that the United States opposes any unilateral action to attempt to overthrow Japan's administration of the Senkaku Islands.\n","I said that freedom of navigation operations and other actions by the U.S. forces in the South China Sea contribute to maintaining maritime order based on the rule of law, and that I support these efforts. We agree that, including capacity-building initiatives, we will enhance engagement in the South China Sea.\n","I conveyed my thinking that for the regional peace and stability Japan continues to play a proactive role.\n","Secretary Mattis communicated to me about the U.S. obligation to defend Japan and its ironclad commitment to extended deterrence. Based on the Japan-U.S. guidelines, deterrence and the response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance need to be further reinforced. We agreed to this understanding. Realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan is an important project to mitigate the impact on the local communities, including Okinawa.\n","I asked Secretary Mattis for cooperation in steady progress for realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan. Secretary Mattis said he would like to move ahead with it in cooperation with Japan.\n","Also, I told him that relocation and the return of MCAS Futnenma needs to be realized as soon as possible. We agreed that relocation of it to Henoko is the only solution, and we will continue to cooperate. I requested cooperation for mitigating the impact on Okinawa. We agreed to cooperate to ensure stable stationing of U.S. forces in Japan.\n","Lastly, I would like to say, having had this opportunity to talk with Secretary Mattis today, these talks were frank and candid and significant. This pleases me tremendously, and based on today's talk I will continue to work hard to strengthen and deepen the Japan-U.S. alliance.\n","Thank you.\n","Moderator: Next, we'd like to invite Secretary Mattis, please.\n","SecDef Mattis: Good morning, everyone. And thank you for being here. And thank you, Minister Inada, for hosting me. I'm very pleased to be visiting Japan on my first trip overseas as Secretary of Defense. It's been many years since I first served in Japan as a young lieutenant in the Marines, but I have fond memories and good friends from that time.\n","It's clear that much has changed since those years. But one thing is certain: The alliance between the United States and Japan is enduring and will remain as the cornerstone of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. Let me assure you that President Trump's administration places a high priority on this region, and specifically on long-term allies like Japan. As I told Minister Inada, the United States remains committed to the defense of -- of Japan under the Treaty of Mutual Security, and we stand ready to enhance our alliance to the benefit of regional peace, prosperity, and freedom.\n","Today the minister and I discussed the security situation and I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku Islands stands. The United States will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands, and as such Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty applies.\n","As the Japanese people know so well, jointly we faced many security challenges in this region. From the threat of nuclear and missile provocations by North Korea to increasingly confrontational behavior by China in the East and South China Seas, we recognize the changing security situation.\n","In our meeting together, Minister Inada and I confirmed our intention to continue close coordination on these and other security issues. I also expressed the United States' appreciation for Japan's stabilizing and strengthening efforts with Southeast Asian partners, which contribute to the regional peace, prosperity, and freedom.\n","The U.S.-Japan alliance is critical to ensuring that this region remain safe and secure, not just now, but for years to come.\n","The 2015 defense guideline in Japan's peace and security legislation1 lay the foundation for us to do much more together, to increase interoperability between our forces and to bolster Japan's capabilities from peacetime to contingency if needed.\n","I am certain that the coming years will see important strides on both sides to realize our mutual goal of a strong defense of Japan and a stable regional environment in which all nations play by the broadly accepted international rules and can prosper free from fear.\n","The United States has invested in the alliance by deploying our most advanced capabilities to Japan, and by maintaining a robust force structure.\n","I also mentioned to Minister Inada that the United States remains committed to mutually agreed upon realignment plans. These include relocating Marines to Guam, and reducing our footprint on Okinawa, while maintaining the capabilities needed to keep Japan and the region secure.\n","During my discussions here we agreed that our mutual efforts to build the Futenma replacement facility will continue, as it is the only solution that will enable the United States to return the current Marine Corps Air Station at Futenma to Japan.\n","Japan has made noteworthy contributions to regional security and to the alliance, and the United States deeply appreciates these contributions. But make no mistake, in my meeting with Japanese leaders both our nations recognize that we must not be found complacent in the face of the emerging challenges. As our alliance grows it will be important for both of our nations to continue investing in our defense personnel and capabilities. In this manner we will ensure that we are true partners together, today and in the years to come. The United States stands with our friends and allies.\n","Thank you again, Minister Inada, for hosting me. It is a pleasure to be back in Japan, and I look forward to hosting you in Washington. Thank you.\n","Moderator: Next, we'd like to move on to representative questions. In the interest of time, we'd like to entertain two questions from each, Japan and the United States. Those of you who ask questions, please raise your hand. When designated please come to the standing mic in front. Please state your name and affiliation before asking a question, either to Minister Inada or Secretary Mattis -- state which person your question is directed to. And after asking the question please return to your seat.\n","First I would like to take up one question from the Japanese side.\n","Nakamura-san.\n","Question [through translator]: My name's Nakamura with NHK. Thank you. With Secretary Mattis, and to Minister [Inada], I would like to ask both of you this question: What are your thoughts on the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance and the roles of the respective countries? Does your understanding that Senkaku Islands of Okinawa prefecture is within the scope of the [inaudible] security pact remain unchanged? In South and East China Seas maritime advances are strengthened by China. Nuclear and missile development is promoted by DPRK. How will you respond to them? How are you going to work on relocation of MCAS Futenma. Thank you.\n","Moderator: First, Minister Inada, please.\n","Defense Minister Inada [through translator]: First, with respect to Japan-U.S. alliance and its importance, this is unshakable. For Japan's peace and security, and for the entire region's peace and stability and prosperity, and for the regional's future, this is very important. This point was once again reaffirmed in today's talks. And the U.S. side many times said that the Senkaku Islands are the government of Japan's -- under the government of Japan's administration, and it is within the scope of Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.\n","And in the new administration, Secretary Mattis clearly stated that they are within the scope of the treaty. And through the continued presence of the United States, the U.S. will strengthen its commitment to the region, and now the security -- the environment surrounding Japan is increasingly difficult. And against this backdrop the U.S. commitment I believe is very significant.\n","And also with respect to DPRK and China, you also asked the question about this. Now there's a need to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance's deterrence and response capabilities. We agreed on this point, and for the regional peace and stability. Japan will play a proactive role and also we will strengthen our role in the alliance. This point has been communicated to Secretary Mattis. China is a very important neighbor for Japan, and so constructive dialogue -- for the constructive dialog we are always open. Our door is always open. This was also communicated.\n","With respect to MCAS Futenma, the relocation of it to Henoko is the only solution, and this position was once again reaffirmed with Secretary Mattis and the -- as far as the government of Japan is concerned we have an intention to steadily move ahead with the work toward relocation. Based on the results of today's talks we would like to further solidify the ties of the Japan-U.S. alliance which is unshaken based on the trusting relationship. The -- There's an attempt to change the status quo by force, but -- for -- in order to establish peace and stability and the rule of law I would like to further work with the countries with -- that share that value.\n","Moderator: Secretary Mattis, please?\n","SecDef Mattis: As Minister Inada stated, the alliance is unshakeable, and between the two of us standing together we're stronger together. We're strong with South Korea. And yet there is no complacency in terms of the alliance. We know we have got to adjust to the changing security situation. We will do so in measured steps, working together. And I don't see any reason right now to think we cannot maintain stability in the -- in the Asia-Pacific region, especially with China.\n","Thank you.\n","Moderator: Next, we'd like to have a question from the U.S. side, please.\n","Question: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. It's Robert Burns of Associated Press. The White House a few days ago said that it was putting Iran on notice. The question is on notice for what? And as defense secretary, are you going to put more military muscle behind those words? For example, by deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Gulf, or making other military contingency moves? Otherwise, aren't those just empty words, to put them on notice?\n","And if I may ask you in a related question, you said earlier, including at your confirmation hearing, that you felt that the counter-ISIL campaign should be accelerated. I'm wondering, as it pertains to recapturing Raqqa, will this possibly involve sending more U.S. troops to Syria?\n","If I may ask a question of Minister Inada. You mentioned in your opening statement that Japan intends to increase and strengthen its role on the alliance. Is Japan prepared to address U.S. concerns about contributing more financially to hosting U.S. forces in Japan?\n","Thank you.\n","SecDef Mattis: As far as Iran goes, this is single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and I think it is wise to make certain that Iran recognizes that what it is doing is getting the attention of a lot of people. And we have responsibility, along with the rest of the nations that want to maintain stability, to be absolutely clear with Iran in this regard. It does no good to -- to ignore it. It does no good to dismiss it. And at the same time I don't see any need to increase the number of forces we have in the Middle East at this time. That's not a -- That's not in the cards right now. We always have the capability to do so, but right now I don't think it's necessary.\n","But I would also just say that we do not have a situation, vis a vis Iran, that shows respect, again, for the rules-based international order. We have seen their -- their misconduct, their misbehavior, from Lebanon and Syria to Bahrain and to Yemen, and it's got to be addressed at some point.\n","Minister?\n","Moderator: Next Minister Inada, please.\n","Defense Minister Inada [through translator]: The Japan-U.S. alliance -- this is for Japan and also for the future of this region, is a very important alliance, and the importance is increasing, I believe. Against this background, in this alliance, what kind of roles Japan will play? And also, proactive playing of roles was mentioned now under the Abe administration, the peace and security legislation, and also through the Japan-U.S. Security guidelines.\n","For example, we are able to protect the U.S. assets and also -- limited exercise of force would be allowed. So within the permission of the Japan -- Japanese constitution, we are contributing to the peace of the world, and also -- also we are doing activities to contribute to the Japan-U.S. alliance.\n","And furthermore, when -- in the administration the -- the national defense program guidelines have been revised and -- and now. Before the Abe administration, the -- the defense expenditure was growing negatively, but after the Abe [administration] came into place, every year this has been growing.\n","So, the Japan's defense capabilities have been strengthened steadily and securely. Now, the strengthening of Japan's defense capabilities and also to the countries that share the values that we [are] also providing the capacity building, and also for the region we are playing a --a proactive role also in the Japan's alliance.\n","And also with the secretary, with respect to the burden on the costs for the U.S. forces in Japan, there was no discussion whatsoever. Based upon the agreement between the two countries, appropriate burden sharing is happening.\n","Moderator: The second question from the Japanese side please.\n","Onuma-san, please?\n","Question [through translator]: My name's Onuma with Jiji Press. To both the Secretary Mattis and Minister Inada, as was mentioned by Minister Inada, President Trump during the campaign referred to increasing Japan's burden of cost for stationing U.S. forces in Japan. On this point Mattis -- Secretary Mattis, now you have expressed your intention to ask the allies to increase the burden of costs. Now, how are you going to respond to that? And also, what do you think of the Japan's defense budget, which accounts for about one percent of GDP?\n","Moderator: To Minister Inada first, please.\n","Defense Minister Inada [through translator]: Right. Regarding the point of cost of burden for stationing U.S. forces in Japan, as I said before, in these talks there was no discussion on that particular point.\n","And also the burden sharing in the alliance -- not really restricted to the financial aspects. And also, regarding the defense-related expenditures, again, as I mentioned before, we have midterm defense build-up program, covering from fiscal 2014 to 2018. Based on this midterm defense build-up program, in five years, [on] average, the plan is to increase it by 0.8 percent [on] average. So we will endeavor to develop the defense capabilities steadily and continuously. And in my talks with the secretary, based on the security environment that is increasingly becoming more difficult, both the qualitatively and quantitatively, Japan, we're strengthening defense capabilities, and expand the role that the Japan can play. This point has been communicated.\n","Moderator: Secretary Mattis, next please.\n","SecDef Mattis: I believe that Japan has been a model of cost sharing, of burden sharing. We have constant dialogue about this. We['ve] worked through the details, but we can point to our Japanese-American cost-sharing approach as an example for other nations to follow. And we have watched as the security situation worsened, and watched the budget grow under Prime Minister Abe and the minister of defense guidance, and I think it's prudent that we take those steps and we adapt the militaries, both our military positions, to the security situation we face today and anticipate tomorrow. And I think Japan is on the right track.\n","Moderator: Lastly, the second question from the U.S. side please.\n","Question: Demetri Sevastopulo from Financial Times. Secretary Mattis, the U.S. has made little progress in recent years urging China to slow down or to stop its activity, particularly it's construction activity, in the South China Sea. Do you think the U.S. needs to adopt a more assertive policy in the South China Sea? And if so, what kind of military measures do you think should be tried?\n","And for Inada Daijin [Minister].\n","[Question asked in Japanese -- through translator]: The DPRK's threat is becoming increasing. Now if the U.S. side -- proactive attack, if that's communicated to the Japan, what would be the response, reaction of the Abe administration?\n","Defense Minister Inada [through translator]: Sorry, I didn't get the [question].\n","Question [through translator]: If the U.S. side asks, announces to Japan that there's -- well, first the...attack to the DPRK, what would be the reaction of the Abe administration?\n","Moderator: Starting with Secretary Mattis, please.\n","SecDef Mattis: Briefly, we've watched in the South China Sea, as China has shredded the trust of nations in the region, apparently trying having to have a veto authority over the diplomatic and security and economic conditions of the neighboring states. And the point behind a \"rules-based international order,\" what those words mean is that we all play by the rules, and if we have disputes we take them to arbitration. We don't settle them by taking military means and occupying land that is subject to question -- to say the least -- about who actually owns it, or is it international waters.\n","So, what we have to do is exhaust all -- all efforts, diplomatic efforts, to try and resolve this properly, maintain open lines of communication. And certainly our military stance should be one that reinforces our diplomats in this regard. But there is no need, right now at this time, for military maneuvers, or something like that, that would -- that would solve something that's best solved by the diplomats. At the same time, freedom of navigation is absolute. And whether it be commercial shipping or our U.S. Navy, we will practice in international waters and transit international waters as appropriate. So, at this time, we do not see any need for dramatic military moves at all.\n","Moderator: Next, Minister Inada please.\n","Defense Minister Inada [through translator]: Right. Regarding DPRK, last year the two nuclear tests were conducted and also with respect to missiles, 20 -- more than 20 missiles were launched from submarines, as well as Musudan; and also from the same place, three missiles were -- actually landed in the waters simultaneously. So DPRK's missile threat is now in a new stage.\n","And beyond that, Japan has Article 9 of the Constitution and we have a defense-only posture. And we have strike capability -- we don't have strike capability. On this point, between Japan and the United States, we have division of roles, but first we have to make sure that this kind of a situation will not happen. We have to cooperate.\n","And furthermore, in this region the Japan and U.S. has ties, and we have to strengthen the alliance. The U.S. has strike capability. This is a deterrence. And so including all these to the DPRK, we have to confront the nation.\n","Moderator: Now the time is up. I would like to conclude the joint press conference. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," a very significant exchange of views took place in today's meeting. u.s. secretary of defense says the Senkaku Islands are under the administration of the government of japan, and fall within the scope of Article 5 of Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. --------------------------\n","639 \n","Original text: The big station 93BLX: It is the Gulf Coast number 1 for hip hop and R&B and now with Ray Ray and Myronda the home team in the morning. \"Do It To It\" -- what better song to do it to it.\n","It's Inetta the Moodsetta and I told you I had a very important announcement and here it is: I refuse, I refuse to walk around and watch people on my job lookin' over my shoulder.

It was September, not last year but the year before that -- September 2010 -- and I got a phone call from my friend, Peter.\n","\"Aaron,\" he said, \"there's an amazing bill that you have to take a look at.\"\n","\"Well, what is it?\" I said.\n","\"It's called 'COICA' -- 'The 'Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeit Act.'\"\n","\"Peter,\" I said, \"I don't care about copyright law. Maybe you're right. Maybe Hollywood is right. But either way, what's the big deal? I'm not gonna waste my life fighting over a little issue like copyright. Health Care, Financial Reform -- those are the issues that I work on, not something obscure like copyright law.\"\n","I could hear Peter grumbling in the background.\n","\"Look, I don't have the time to argue with you,\" he said, \"but it doesn't matter for right now because this isn't a bill about copyright.\"\n","\"It's not?\"\n","\"No,\" he said. \"It's a bill about the freedom to connect.\"\n","Now I was listening. Peter explained what you’ve all probably long since learned: that this bill would let the government devise a list of websites that Americans weren’t allowed to visit. On the next day, I came up with lots of ways to try to explain this to people. I said it was a great firewall of America. I said it was an Internet blacklist. I said it was online censorship. But I think it’s worth taking a step back, putting aside all the rhetoric, and just thinking for a moment about how radical this bill really was.\n","Sure, there are lots of times when the government makes rules about speech. If you slander a private figure, if you buy a television ad that lies to people, if you have a wild party that plays booming music all night: In all these cases, the government can come stop you. But this was something radically different. It wasn’t that the government went to people and asked them to take down particular material that was illegal. It shut down whole websites. Essentially it stopped Americans from communicating entirely with certain groups.\n","There’s nothing really like it in U.S. law. If you play loud music all night, the government doesn’t slap you with an order requiring you be mute for the next couple weeks. They don’t say nobody can make any more noise inside your house. There’s a specific complaint, which they ask you to specifically remedy, and then your life goes on. The closet example I could find was a case where the government was at war with an adult bookstore. The place kept selling pornography, the government kept getting the porn declared illegal and then, frustrated, they decided to shut the whole bookstore down. But even that was eventually declared unconstitutional, a violation of the First Amendment.\n","So, you might say surely COICA would get declared unconstitutional as well. But I knew that the Supreme Court had a blind spot around the First Amendment -- more than anything else, more than slander or libel, more than pornography, more even than even child pornography. Their blind spot was copyright. When it came to copyright, it was like part of the justices’ brains shut off and they just totally forgot about the First Amendment. You got the sense that deep down they didn’t even think the First Amendment applied when copyright was at issue. Which means that if you did want to censor the Internet, if you wanted to come up with some way that the government could shut down access to particular websites, this bill might be the only way to do it. If it was about pornography, it probably would get overturned by courts just like the adult bookstore case. But if you claimed it was about copyright, it might just sneak through.\n","And that was especially terrifying because, as you know, copyright is everywhere. If you want to shut down WikiLeaks, it’s a bit of stretch to claim that you’re doing it because they have too much pornography. But it’s not hard at all to claim that WikiLeaks is violating copyright, because everything is copyrighted. This speech, you know, the thing I am giving right now, these words are copyrighted. And it’s so easy to accidently copy something. So easy, in fact, that the leading Republican supporter of COICA, Orrin Hatch, had illegally copied a bunch of code into his own Senate website. So if even Orrin Hatch‘s Senate website was found to be violating copyright law, what’s the chance that they wouldn’t find something they could pin on any of us.\n","There’s a battle going on right now, a battle to define everything that happens on the Internet in terms of traditional things that the law understands. Is sharing a video on BitTorrent like shoplifting from a movie store, or is it like loaning a videotape to a friend? Is reloading a webpage over and over again like a peaceful virtual sit-in or a violent smashing of shop windows? Is the freedom to connect like freedom of speech or like the freedom to murder?\n","This bill would be a huge potentially permanent loss. If we lost the ability to communicate with each other over the Internet, it would be a change to the Bill of Rights, the freedoms guaranteed in our Constitution. The freedoms our country had been built on would be suddenly deleted. New technology, instead of bringing us greater freedom, would have snuffed out fundamental rights we’d always taken for granted. And I realized that day, talking to Peter, that I couldn’t let that happen.\n","But it was going to happen. The bill, COICA, was introduced on September 20, 2010, a Monday. And in the press release heralding the introduction of this bill, way at the bottom, it was scheduled for a vote on September 23, just three days later. And while of course there had to be a vote -- you can’t pass a bill without a vote -- the results of that vote were already a foregone conclusion. Because if you looked at the introduction of the law, it wasn’t just introduced by one rogue eccentric member of Congress; it was introduced by the chair of the Judiciary Committee and co-sponsored by nearly all the other members, Republicans and Democrats. So yes, there’d be a vote but it wouldn’t be much of a surprise because nearly everyone who was voting had signed their name to the bill before it was even introduced.\n","Now I can’t stress how unusual this is -- this is emphatically not how Congress works. I’m -- I’m not talking about how Congress should work, the way you see on Schoolhouse Rock. I mean, this is not the way Congress actually works. I mean, I think we all know Congress is a dead zone of deadlock and dysfunction. There are months of debates and horse-trading and hearings and stall tactics. I mean, you know, first you’re supposed to announce that you’re gonna hold hearings on a problem and then days of experts talking about the issue and then you propose a possible solution, you bring the experts back for their thoughts on that. And then other members have different solutions and they propose those and you spend a bunch of time debating and there’s a bunch of trading to get members over to your cause and finally you spend hours talking one-on-one with the different people in the debate, try and come back with some sort of compromise which you hash out in endless backroom meetings. And then when that’s all done you take that and you go through it line by line in public to see if anyone has any objections or wants to make any changes and then you have the vote. It is a painful, arduous process. You don’t just introduce a bill on Monday and then pass it unanimously a couple days later. That just doesn’t happen in Congress.\n","But this time, it was going to happen. And it wasn’t because there were no disagreements on the issue; there are always disagreements. Some senators thought the bill was much too weak and needed to be stronger. As it was introduced the bill only allowed the government to shut down websites and these senators, they wanted any company in the world to have the power to get a website shut down. Other senators thought it was a drop too strong. But somehow in the kind of thing you never see in Washington, they’d all managed to put their personal differences aside to come together and support one bill they were persuaded they could all live with – a bill that would censor the Internet. And when I saw this I realized whoever was behind this was good.\n","Now the typical way you make good things happen in Washington is you find a bunch of wealthy companies who agree with you. Social security didn’t get passed because some brave politicians decided their good conscience couldn’t possibly let old people die starving in the streets. I mean, are you kidding me? Social security got passed because John D. Rockefeller was sick of having to take money out of his profits to pay for his workers’ pension funds. Why do that when you can just let the government take money from the workers? Now my point is not that social security is a bad thing -- I think it’s fantastic. It’s just that the way you get the government to do fantastic things is you find a big company willing to back them. The problem is, of course, that big companies aren’t really huge fans of civil liberties. You know, it’s -- it’s not that they’re against them; it’s just that there’s not much money in it.\n","Now if you’ve been reading the press you probably didn’t hear this part of the story. As Hollywood has been telling it, the great, good copyright bill that they were pushing was stopped by the evil Internet companies who make millions of dollars off of copyright infringement. But it just -- it really wasn’t true. I mean, I was in there, in the meetings with the Internet companies -- actually you’re probably all here today. And, you know, if all their profits depended on copyright infringement, they would have put a lot more money into changing copyright law. The fact is the big Internet companies, they would do just fine if this bill passed. I mean they wouldn’t be thrilled about it but I doubt they would have even have a noticeable dip in their stock price.\n","So they were against it but they were against it like the rest of us on grounds primarily of principle; and principle doesn’t have a lot of money in the budget to spend on lobbyists. So they were practical about it. \"Look,\" they said, \"this bill is going to pass; in fact it’s probably gonna pass unanimously, and as much as we try, this is not a train we’re going to be able to stop. So were not gonna support it. We couldn’t support it, but in opposition, let’s just try and make it better.\" So that was the strategy: Lobby to make the bill better. They had lists of changes that would make the bill less obnoxious or less expensive for them, or whatever. But the fact remained at the end of the day, it was going to be a bill that was gonna censor the Internet, and there was nothing we could do to stop it.\n","So I did what you always do when you’re a little guy facing a terrible future with long odds and little hope of success: I started an online petition. I called all my friends, and we stayed up all night setting up a website for this new group, Demand Progress, with an online petition opposing this noxious bill, and I sent it to a few friends. Now, I’ve done a few online petitions before. I’ve worked at some of the biggest groups in the world that do online petitions. I’ve written a ton of them and read even more. But I’ve never seen anything like this. Starting from literally nothing, we went to 10,000 signers, then 100,000 signers, and then 200,000 signers and 300,000 signers, in just a couple of weeks. And it wasn’t just signing a name. We asked those people to call Congress, to call urgently. There was a vote coming up this week, in just a couple days, and we had to stop it. And at the same time, we told the press about it, about this incredible online petition that was taking off. And we met with the staff of members of Congress and pleaded with them to withdraw their support for the bill. I mean, it was amazing. It was huge. The power of the Internet rose up in force against this bill. And then it passed unanimously.\n","Now, to be fair, several of the members gave nice speeches before casting their vote, and in their speeches they said their office had been overwhelmed with comments about the First Amendment concerns behind this bill, comments that had them very worried. So worried, in fact, they weren’t sure that they still supported the bill. But even though they didn’t support it, they were gonna vote for it anyway, they said, because they needed to keep the process moving, and they were sure any problems that were had with it could be fixed later. So, I’m gonna ask you, does this sound like Washington, D.C., to you? Since when do members of Congress vote for things that they oppose just to keep the process moving? I mean, whoever was behind this was good.\n","And then, suddenly, the process stopped. Senator Ron Wyden, the Democrat from Oregon, put a hold on the bill. Giving a speech in which he called it a nuclear bunker-buster bomb aimed at the Internet, he announced he would not allow it to pass without changes. And as you may know, a single senator can’t actually stop a bill by themselves, but they can delay it. By objecting to a bill, they can demand Congress spend a bunch of time debating it before getting it passed. And Senator Wyden did. He bought us time -- a lot of time, as it turned out. His delay held all the way through the end of that session of Congress, so that when the bill came back, it had to start all over again. And since they were starting all over again, they figured, why not give it a new name? And that’s when it began being called PIPA, and eventually SOPA.\n","So there was probably a year or two of delay there. And in retrospect, we used that time to lay the groundwork for what came later. But that’s not what it felt like at the time. At the time, it felt like we were going around telling people that these bills were awful, and in return, they told us that they thought we were crazy. I mean, we were kids wandering around waving our arms about how the government was gonna censor the Internet. It does sound a little crazy. You can ask Larry tomorrow. I was constantly telling him what was going on, trying to get him involved, and I’m pretty sure he just thought I was exaggerating. Even I began to doubt myself. It -- It was a rough period. But when the bill came back and started moving again, suddenly all the work we had done started coming together. All the folks we talked to about it suddenly began getting really involved and getting others involved. Everything started snowballing. It happened so fast.\n","I -- I remember there was one week where I was having dinner with a friend in the technology industry, and he asked what I worked on, and I told him about this bill. And he said, \"Wow! You need to tell people about that.\" And I -- I just groaned. And then, just a few weeks later, I remember I was chatting with this cute girl on the subway, and she wasn’t in technology at all, but when she heard that I was, she turned to me very seriously and said, \"You know, we have to stop 'SOAP.'\" So, progress, right?\n","But, I think that story illustrates what happened during those couple weeks, because the reason we won wasn’t because I was working on it or Reddit was working on it or Google was working on it or Tumblr or any other particular person. It was because there was this enormous mental shift in our industry. Everyone was thinking of ways they could help, often really clever, ingenious ways. People made videos. They made infographics. They started PACs. They designed ads. They bought billboards. They wrote news stories. They held meetings. Everybody saw it as their responsibility to help. I remember at one point during this period I held a meeting with a bunch of startups in New York, trying to encourage everyone to get involved, and I felt a bit like I was hosting one of these Clinton Global Initiative meetings, where I got to turn to every startup in the -- every startup founder in the room and be like, \"What are you going to do?\" \"And what are you going to do?\" And everyone was trying to one-up each other.\n","If there was one day the shift crystallized, I think it was the day of the hearings on SOPA in the House, the day we got that phrase, \"It’s no longer OK not to understand how the Internet works.\" There was just something about watching those clueless members of Congress debate the bill, watching them insist they could regulate the Internet and a bunch of nerds couldn’t possibly stop them. They really brought it home for people that this was happening, that Congress was going to break the Internet, and it just didn’t care.\n","I remember when this moment first hit me. I was at an event, and I was talking, and I got introduced to a U.S. senator, one of the strongest proponents of the original COICA bill, in fact. And I asked him why, despite being such a progressive, despite giving a speech in favor of civil liberties, why he was supporting a bill that would censor the Internet. And, you know, that typical politician smile he had suddenly faded from his face, and his eyes started burning this fiery red. And he started shouting at me, said, \"Those people on the Internet, they think they can get away with anything! They think they can just put anything up there, and there’s nothing we can do to stop them! They put up everything! They -- They put up our nuclear missiles, and they just laugh at us! Well, we’re gonna show them! There’s got to be laws on the Internet! It’s got to be under control!\"\n","Now, as far as I know, nobody has ever put up the U.S.'s nuclear missiles on the Internet. I mean, it's not something I’ve heard about. But that’s sort of the point. He wasn’t having a rational concern, right? It was this irrational fear that things were out of control. Here was this man, a United States senator, and those people on the Internet, they were just mocking him. They had to be brought under control. Things had to be under control. And I think that was the attitude of Congress. And just as seeing that fire in that senator’s eyes scared me, I think those hearings scared a lot of people. They saw this wasn’t the attitude of a thoughtful government trying to resolve trade-offs in order to best represent its citizens. This was more like the attitude of a tyrant. And so the citizens fought back.\n","The wheels came off the bus pretty quickly after that hearing. First the Republican senators pulled out, and then the White House issued a statement opposing the bill, and then the Democrats, left all alone out there, announced they were putting the bill on hold so they could have a few further discussions before the official vote. And that was when, as hard as it was for me to believe, after all this, we had won. The thing that everyone said was impossible, that some of the biggest companies in the world had written off as kind of a pipe dream, had happened. We did it. We won.\n","And then we started rubbing it in. You all know what happened next. Wikipedia went black. Reddit went black. Craigslist went black. The phone lines on Capitol Hill flat-out melted. Members of Congress started rushing to issue statements retracting their support for the bill that they were promoting just a couple days ago. And it was just ridiculous. I mean, there’s a chart from the time that captures it pretty well. It says something like \"January 14th\" on one side and has this big, long list of names supporting the bill, and then just a few lonely people opposing it; and on the other side, it says \"January 15th,\" and now it’s totally reversed -- everyone is opposing it, just a few lonely names still hanging on in support.\n","I mean, this really was unprecedented. Don’t take my word for it, but ask former Senator Chris Dodd, now the chief lobbyist for Hollywood. He admitted, after he lost, that he had masterminded the whole evil plan. And he told The New York Times he had never seen anything like it during his many years in Congress. And everyone I’ve spoken to agrees. The people rose up, and they caused a sea change in Washington -- not the press, which refused to cover the story -- just coincidentally, their parent companies all happened to be lobbying for the bill; not the politicians, who were pretty much unanimously in favor of it; and not the companies, who had all but given up trying to stop it and decided it was inevitable.\n","It was really stopped by the people, the people themselves. They killed the bill dead, so dead that when members of Congress propose something now that even touches the Internet, they have to give a long speech beforehand about how it is definitely not like SOPA; so dead that when you ask Congressional staffers about it, they groan and shake their heads like it’s all a bad dream they’re trying really hard to forget; so dead that it’s kind of hard to believe this story, hard to remember how close it all came to actually passing, hard to remember how this could have gone any other way. But it wasn’t a dream or a nightmare; it was all very real.\n","And it will happen again. Sure, it will have yet another name, and maybe a different excuse, and probably do its damage in a different way. But make no mistake: The enemies of the freedom to connect have not disappeared. The fire in those politicians’ eyes hasn’t been put out. There are a lot of people, a lot of powerful people, who want to clamp down on the Internet. And to be honest, there aren’t a whole lot who have a vested interest in protecting it from all of that. Even some of the biggest companies, some of the biggest Internet companies, to put it frankly, would benefit from a world in which their little competitors could get censored. We can’t let that happen.\n","Now, I’ve told this as a personal story, partly because I think big stories like this one are just more interesting at human scale. The director J.D. Walsh says good stories should be like the poster for Transformers. There’s a huge evil robot on the left side of the poster and a huge, big army on the right side of the poster. And in the middle, at the bottom, there’s just a small family trapped in the middle. Big stories need human stakes.\n","But mostly, it’s a personal story, because I didn’t have time to research any of the other part of it. But that’s kind of the point. We won this fight because everyone made themselves the hero of their own story. Everyone took it as their job to save this crucial freedom. They threw themselves into it. They did whatever they could think of to do. They didn’t stop to ask anyone for permission. You remember how Hacker News readers spontaneously organized this boycott of GoDaddy over their support of SOPA? Nobody told them they could do that. A few people even thought it was a bad idea. It didn’t matter.\n","The senators were right: The Internet really is out of control. But if we forget that, if we let Hollywood rewrite the story so it was just big company Google who stopped the bill, if we let them persuade us we didn’t actually make a difference, if we start seeing it as someone else’s responsibility to do this work and it’s our job just to go home and pop some popcorn and curl up on the couch to watch Transformers, well, then next time they might just win.\n","Let’s not let that happen. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," \"it's a bill about the freedom to connect,\" one friend says. he says the bill would let the government devise lists of websites that Americans weren't allowed to visit, but it stopped people from communicating entirely with them. \"i'm not gonna waste my life fighting over something like copyright.\" --------------------------\n","643 \n","Original text: Mr. Bossert: Thanks, Sarah. Good afternoon. As you know, President Trump has put people first and paperwork second. He's had us call out and pull out all the stops, and put out as much federal relief into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as we can muster. And we've been ongoing in our efforts to accomplish that and meet his objectives over the last eight days.\n","And I'm here to take some questions. I know you've heard some reporting from Sarah, so if I could, I'll just jump right in.\n","Peter.\n","Question: If I can ask you -- first of all, thanks for being here. Specifically on the Jones Act, which has been the focus of a lot of attention in the course of the last 24 to 72 hours right now, critics say the White House should have moved more quickly in waiving the Jones Act, lawmakers among them. Why is that an unfounded complaint?\n","Mr. Bossert: Okay, so it is an unfounded complaint and here's why: The Jones Act, real briefly stated, is a rule that favors flag vessels -- U.S. flag vessels. If there are not enough U.S. flag vessels -- the capacity, in other words -- to meet the need, then we waive the Jones Act. In this particular case, we had enough capacity of U.S. flag vessels to take more than, or to exceed the requirement and need of diesel fuel and other commodities into Puerto Rico.\n","What happened is, I think almost 17 or 18 days' worth of now what you're seeing -- backlogged diesel fuel need in the island. But it was a little bit misunderstood and misreported that we had a capacity problem and had to waive the Jones Act. Not the case. The idea here is that we had provided as many commodities as were necessary to the island. The challenge became, then, land-based distribution. That remains the challenge; that remains the priority today.\n","However, last night, Governor Rosselló called me a little after eight o'clock and said, at this point, to ensure that the additional needs are met as we move forward, it might be a good idea to proactively make sure that we pull out all the stops just in case that capacity problem ran into the requirement problem. I talked to the President; he thought that was absolutely the right thing to do, and waived it right away.\n","So that was not too late. It was not even too early. It was just the right thing to do proactively.\n","Question: So to be very clear, through this point, then obviously distribution is one of the biggest challenges. You talked about 44 of 69 hospitals now being up and running as necessary to bring those people whose lives are at risk. What percentage of the country would you say you really haven’t had a chance to even explore to see how they've been impacted by this?\n","Mr. Bossert: Yeah, so it's hard to answer the percentage of the country, so I'll answer it this way: Through aerial surveillance we've seen the entirety of Puerto Rico. Some of the southwest and southeast sections of the island have had a little bit more sparse on-foot exploration. But it's the interior of the island that's presenting the biggest problem for us right now. The mountainous interior is where we're dedicating our efforts to try to get in with rotary wing support. The margins, so to speak, are now open to airports and seaports, so that's where we're freeing up some of that delivery.\n","But again, back to the Jones Act question, we had -- up until the waiver last night -- enough capacity in U.S. flag vessels to get all the commodities necessary into the island. We just then ran into the priority challenge of distributing land-based commodities into the people, and that's -- if I can pivot before I take the next question, that's a challenge or a function of two problems:\n","First, the capacity of the locals in the state were diminished because those people are victims, as well, that work for the state and work for the local authorities. And then, secondly, the debris and down power lines had to be pushed out of the way. And so we've got the resources there to do that now, but that's the challenge remaining.\n","The central interior is going to be reviewed and looked at very carefully over the next 24, 48 hours to make sure we're getting the needs of the people met.\n","Question: A quick follow on John, if I could. Had Governor Rosselló, Tom, not requested -- protectively -- a waiver in the Jones Act, would you have seen a compelling reason to initiate a waiver?\n","Mr. Bossert: I wouldn't have, and I wasn't recommending to the President that he waive the Jones Act at the time until I got the governor's request. And it may be a historical note of relevance: Sometimes we'll see the carriers request the waiver, right? So you'll have foreign flag vessels or U.S. flag vessels or carrier companies call us and say, \"Please waive it because there's an issue.\" We didn't get, to my knowledge, any carrier requests.\n","But once the governor calls and says, \"Proactively, as I see out into the future, on the horizon\" -- then I think that we should listen to him. And the President completely agreed.\n","Question: Was this just all overhyped, in simple terms?\n","Mr. Bossert: Well, perhaps misunderstood. I think there's also some critics that believe that it was a price issue, and for those, I can't answer it. I don't know how the markets price these things. But I can tell you is already bought and paid for by the U.S. taxpayer in a humanitarian effort, and I think it's an absolutely wise investment to save lives, whether they're U.S. citizens or not.\n","In this particular case, we've got U.S. Virgin Island citizens, Puerto Rican citizens -- all American citizens. I think that's the right investment to make. Whether it could have changed the price point, I don't know. There was an op-ed piece on that.\n","But capacity is the issue. Lifesaving requirements -- that's the need. And we had that capacity met.\n","Yes, ma'am.\n","Question: Tom, your need is immediate, and with all the challenges that are coming, what are the conversations about with airdrops -- just airdropping in certain areas? Because people are talking about running out of water, running out of food like in hours or minutes. What's happening with that conversation? And also, once again, an issue of housing. We're hearing about ships -- cruise ships. What else is going on with this?\n","Mr. Bossert: So there's a number of things happening. With respect to the distribution of commodities, that is the biggest challenge right now. But the restoration of power is also a big challenge, and I'll tell you why. Energy here -- electric power -- is supplying the hospitals that are providing medical care to the wounded and those that brought medical conditions and had chelation needs and other needs.\n","So there's kind of a dual priority going on in terms of power restoration, emergency power, and then blocking, clearing, pushing out of the way all the roads to open them up so we can get commodities delivered. There's still a shortfall there, though, and that is drivers for all those trucks. So we are pushing personnel in to augment state and local authorities to continue to push those commodities.\n","What you saw today, though, I think was some reporting and some loop footage of some trucks sitting on ports and docks. We're moving those trucks quickly. We're also prioritizing what needs to come off first so that we can get generators --\n","Question: Wouldn't airdrops circumvent all of that having to rebuild infrastructure and move things away?\n","Mr. Bossert: Yeah. At this point, if airdrops are under consideration, I'm not aware of it. But I would promote it if it's a faster way to get food and water to people who are in need. We now have a one-star general, General Kim, in place, who's in charge of all ground force operations to make sure there's one person in charge of marshaling all those efforts. And if he recommends airdrop, then I think we airdrop.\n","Sir.\n","Question: Tom, I've got a text here from a volunteer who has boots on the ground, and he says that they need helicopters to evacuate people from remote areas of the island. And he says there are people burying their family members in front yards, communication is badly needed, and they look at apocalyptic conditions between 48 and 72 hours. There's a little bit of disconnect from what I'm hearing here and what they're telling me there. Can you explain the difference?\n","Mr. Bossert: Yeah, no, there's no disconnect. If that's accurate, then it needs to be addressed and remediated immediately. So what I want to do here is be careful not to micromanage it from here. That's the mistake you've seen in the past. I believe -- I'm confident anyway -- that we've got enough resources marshaled and deployed forward to make those decisions under the right command and leadership structure.\n","What we've done, and as I've explained in the past, is we've had to augment and change our business model in the field. We did that last Thursday in earnest; you saw the effects of it over the weekend. But what we did is we had to augment the local and state authorities, not just at the top, but all the way out through and to the lower levels. So now there are federal officials that are identifying needs and requirements, requesting them of the state level, augmenting the state level to validate those requirements, and then from the federal side, providing them.\n","So we are in every stage of the identification, validation, and provision of requirements and the delivery of them to people in need. And a couple of things here: First, people seeing 24- and 48-hour horizon problems where they're saying, I don't see enough food and water coming, it's my sincere belief that that food and water is going to get to them before that deadline arises and that we're going to save their lives. I have no doubt in it. We've got over 10,000 people there now, and there's more on their way, including a lot of aerial support, USS Comfort.\n","I'm going to read the numbers here for you. There's 12 Coast Guard cutters, three United States Navy ships, one DOT Maritime Administration vessel, six commercial ships with supplies in route -- this was as of 5:00 a.m., so there's more since -- seven additional ships to house responders, and we've got commodities distribution now exceeding millions. So 1.3 million meals, 2.7 million liters -- that type of thing -- of water.\n","So that's moving in today, and you're seeing the distribution problem unclogged. Now, if there's somebody burying somebody in their front yard, that's an absolutely terrible story. What I don't want to do though is project it as the norm, and I think there's a careful distinction here.\n","Question: What is the norm?\n","Mr. Bossert: Right now we've seen 16 fatalities confirmed from the state authorities. No fatality is acceptable. If that number increases significantly, that will be a devastating blow. We are going everything we can to prevent that. The loss of life from the storm is one thing; loss of life that's preventable is another. And that's why we're trying to marshal our resources.\n","Ma'am.\n","Question: Senator Rubio, who just got back from the island, says there are significant logistical concerns with the administration's response. He says there's no clear command, control, and communication between local and federal agencies. And he says this requires a response led by DOD. Is that option on the table here?\n","Mr. Bossert: Sure. It's already been undertaken. So I was with the senator briefly on Monday, in Puerto Rico, and I think what he's identifying there is something that we already had in place -- or a solution for. So he's identifying a traditional problem between municipal and state government authorities.\n","Normally, FEMA and the federal government would provide aid to the governor, to the state, and then they would work it out with the local authorities. What we've identified here as of last Thursday, and you saw it implemented over the weekend, was a lack of capacity coupled with this insular several hundred-mile away, divided by an ocean island problem. And so what we've done is provided federal authorities -- largely guys in green, right -- Title X and Title XXXII forces -- but also FEMA emergency managers, to stand next to each of those municipality leaders, whether they're mayors or local authority figures, like the water authority or electric authority leaders. And they're being augmented by federal forces.\n","So we've addressed those challenges in communicating between local and state authorities by augmenting them with federal staff. That's something that wasn't necessarily apparent to the senator as he got there. He identified a problem, but it was a problem already being fixed. And it's one that he probably wasn't able to see at the municipal level for two reasons. One, he didn't get out there to them. Neither of us could make it out to the municipal levels when we visited on Monday. And two, there was a communications problem of grave import that persists to this day, and that communications problem is tied to the electric power restoration problem.\n","If I could, before I take the next question, let me explain why and how the power restoration process is unfolding.\n","What we decided to do is take the action of putting the United States Army Corps of Engineers in charge of power restoration on the island. So to your question about whether the military is in charge, it depends on the mission and function. They're in charge of a lot, but not everything. The people of Puerto Rico are strong, competent, and where they're not diminished in capacity, they're in charge. And that's the best way to handle things. But where they're not able, and where they have diminished capacity, we're taking extreme steps.\n","So a direct federal assistance order was given, a mission assignment was given. I've heard others on TV quibble whether it’s a mission or not. Let me make it clear: General Semonite from the United States Army Corps of Engineers has been given a mission to restore power on Puerto Rico, writ large, full stop. He has some priorities.\n","His priorities are temporary power generation right now. That's the big diesel-run generators that are supporting the hospitals and other lifesaving capabilities. Two, permanent generation. He's going to restore the damaged power generation capacity on the south of the island. Three, transmission. Those are the big lines that transmit power to and from. And then, fourthly, distribution. That's the last mile -- capillaries hook up to the houses and that type of power generation.\n","So those are his priorities, and I'm pretty certain that the Puerto Rican people are going to see the results of a dedicated Army Corps of Engineers mission.\n","Ma'am.\n","Question: If airdrops would help, why are those not happening? Is that a military issue? Is that a problem with them not stepping up?\n","Mr. Bossert: Yeah, it's my belief that right now both the state government and most of the municipalities involved have identified the fastest route is available to them being ground based. If that's not the case, then I'm confident -- but I want to make sure that I don't step in between something that I could be far removed from. If the ground force commander down there has identified an airdrop mission as faster and more productive, then I endorse it from here. I certainly wouldn't question his judgment.\n","But it was my reporting and understanding earlier today that they identified the fastest delivery methodology to be through ground-based means by clearing first and delivering second, and that we needed drivers and we're augmenting them, and they needed security forces, and we've applied those. There's a security force plan now laid down for each of the drivers so that they can feel safe.\n","Yes, sir.\n","Question: Tom, several aid flights have gotten out of South Florida and managed to get to the island and deliver food and water without having logistical problems. There's severe criticism coming from South Florida now, saying that there's mismanagement coming all the way from the President. How do you respond to that?\n","Mr. Bossert: Well, I'm not certain who you're talking about or who's criticizing us. There's plenty of criticism to go around, but I'm pretty confident --\n","Question: The mayor (inaudible) managed to get an aid flight into the island and get it unloaded. And he says the problems that you're having logistically are of your own making from not taking action sooner and bringing in the military sooner.\n","Mr. Bossert: Well, first, I thank the mayor for providing aid. Second, the mayor is just dead wrong in this case, and I would challenge him to go down and get a better understanding first before rendering that verdict on what we've done, what we had been doing, and how blown away you're going to be when you see the full totality of the picture. So I'm certain that the mayor has had some positive experiences. I wouldn't be critical of him personally. But he's probably -- just like with the Jones Act criticism that he rendered -- just not yet informed on the facts.\n","So thanks for that question.\n","Question: How is he able to get supplies through? And why is it that there are 10,000 containers waiting at the port of San Juan?\n","Mr. Bossert: Well, to my point earlier, we're getting a lot of supplies through; it's just perhaps some misreporting that misunderstands that fact.\n","Question: The President has referenced some of the debt and economic problems that Puerto Rico has been struggling with for some time here. When you were talking about the lack of capacity, municipal and state level -- I mean, are you faulting local officials for a lack of preparedness?\n","Mr. Bossert: No, absolutely -- no. Let me be clear, when I say capacity, I'm talking about the capacity problem of people being victims that would otherwise be the first responders, repairers, and managers of the municipal government functions. So what we're doing is trying to restore baseline municipal government functions because they've been affected. Their homes are destroyed, their families are put in peril. That's the capacity problem that I'm addressing.\n","When you talk about money, I believe that the island authority in general, with -- Puerto Rico -- $72 billion in debt, there's a restructuring effort underway. And Congress weighed in with the PROMESA Act, and that $72 billion is being restructured and handled through, in part, bankruptcy proceedings and so forth.\n","Question: But how is that impacting this response? Because the President brought it up.\n","Mr. Bossert: Well, I think the President -- I know the President brought it up in terms of recovery. But here's how it affects the response: What it does is it puts the island in a position where they don't have the financial resources to meet the cost-share requirement for all of these goods and resources, personnel and materiel flowing into the island.\n","What the President did was acknowledge that, publicly and privately; realize that that would be a problem, at the advice of the FEMA administrator, myself, and Secretary Duke; and he took the step of doing a 100 percent federal cost-share adjustment to pay for all of this, from debris removal to debris pushing, power restoration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and all the emergency protective measures -- police, fire, EMS, truck drivers, all those sorts of things -- 180 days, so six months for the Virgin Islands and for Puerto Rico, until we can get our hands around this. All those functions and all those missions that I just described are all 100 percent federal cost-share. We don't want anybody worried about paper; we want them worried about people.\n","I'm going to take two more questions. Sir.\n","Question: I wanted to follow that a little bit and ask: As you're starting to envision, down the road, if any sort of bailout might be part of this sort of broader recovery package, that you look for in a supplemental. And on that supplemental, I know the first crack at it will be relatively soon. Aides on Capitol Hill are suggesting that it could be the first week in October. Is that the timeline that you're anticipated? And have you started to compile that?\n","Mr. Bossert: As my colleague, Mr. Cohn, alluded to, we're certainly willing to negotiate with Congress if there's some better fiscal idea.\n","From an emergency management perspective, in the next coming weeks it's important to understand that FEMA just got a $7.1 billion appropriation released on October 1st, and what's going to happen now is we're going to go back for more. We're going to ask for that in the form of an emergency supplemental to provide money into the fund that does this lifesaving, life-sustaining effort, and even some of the early recovery efforts.\n","Whether we have to address or should address at that point the existing $72 billion worth of debt and how it's been restructured is something that I'll have to take my lead from the economists on and from some of the budget hawks.\n","But I think that the best idea here for us would be to focus on PROMESA and PRASA -- the electric power authority and the water authority. Those are the two concerning elements where they're going to have to be rebuilt, they're going to have to be rebuilt under proper management, and they're going to have to be rebuilt under proper rebuilding codes and standards to make sure that they can withstand a future hurricane, and that we don't just go back to sticks and wires in the future.\n","So we're going to put federal money into this. We should do it wisely and prudently. I've said that from this podium here before. President Trump believes in that seriously. I don't think we're going to have to address the debt restructuring issue in this next go-around, but if we do, and if Congress wants us to, President Trump is up to that challenge.\n","Question: [Inaudible] supplemental?\n","Mr. Bossert: Well, it's going to have to come, I think, in the next two to four weeks, but I can't put a better date on it. I'd refer you to Director Mulvaney.\n","Let me take one more question here.\n","Question: I’m not sure if I still understand -- why has it taken eight days to get a three-star general on the ground to start organizing this? We know the island situation, et cetera. But why eight days?\n","Mr. Bossert: Yeah, well, because it didn't require a three-star general eight days ago. Let me explain to you how the process works. It will be the best way of explaining the answer.\n","We have a three-star general in charge of this, and we had one in charge of this out of San Antonio from day minus-eight and day minus-two and all the way through until today. We forward-deployed a one-star general -- a brigadier general -- to take care of ground force command once we realized the problem of logistics distribution had outstripped the capacity of the affected municipal governments.\n","But that three-star general was there and running and coordinating operations as an extension of NORAD and Northern Command. We've made a number of improvements to that distribution process and that marshaling of military resources since, for instance, General Honoré experienced the problems he did in Katrina. We've matured quite a bit since that day.\n","The three-star command structure that he lacked back then has been put in place and has been in place for this response out of San Antonio, and augmented by a Northern Command structure that's been pretty robust and forward-leaning here. They've been doing vocal authorities; they're not waiting for paperwork. They've been doing things that -- or on-command authority; they don't wait for a governor's request. So all those forward-leaning lessons have been applied here, but perhaps misunderstood.\n","But now the change, move here on day eight was to take that three-star general and to put him there, physically located in the field. I don't anticipate he'll stay there long, but he needs to get there, have his eyes on it, and make sure that he's comfortable with the interaction between his forces and the governor and the municipal forces, because it's a little bit of a different business plan model in the field, and because it's unique and it's an island 1,100 or so miles away from the nearest land in Florida.\n","And so once he's satisfied, I think -- or would expect that three-star general to recede back into his appropriate command structure. But for now, both he and his one-star subordinate command will be there in charge of ground forces and overall military marshals, and we'll end up with a lot more people there over the coming days to try to address this really significant problem and significant need.\n","And if that's okay, I'd like to make that my last question.\n","Question: San Antonio is thousands of miles from Puerto Rico. Why -- was it a mistake -- would you acknowledge it was a mistake, looking back, to not have this three-star general on the ground earlier?\n","Mr. Bossert: No, not at all. In fact, that doesn’t affect the way we stage equipment and the way we handle area command and field operational commands. This is textbook and it's been done well. The unusual step has been to put the three-star general down forward-leaning. So I have every confidence that we'll handle that in the best way possible.\n","Peter, if I could --\n","Question: One quick one --\n","Mr. Bossert: John, I'm going to see if that's my last question, if I can.\n","As I always do, I'm going to end by saying I'd like everyone to say an extra special prayer for the people on Puerto Rico tonight. The U.S. Virgin Islands are dealing well. They're not getting a lot of coverage, but I'd like you to say that prayer for them as well. And also for the 10,000-plus federal workers, several thousand other volunteer workers, businessmen and others, men and women that are helping those in need. Honestly, this is something that is going to require weeks and months' worth of patience as we restore power, get food and water, and return to normalcy.\n","So thank you so much for your time. I'm very proud of the Puerto Rican people, their strength and leadership. Governor Rosselló has our full confidence and faith.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," president obama has put people first and paperwork second. he's had us call out and pull out all the stops, and put out federal relief into Puerto Rico and the u.s. Virgin Islands as we can muster. the white house should have moved more quickly in waiving the Jones Act, lawmakers among them. --------------------------\n","644 \n","Original text: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: My subject is \"The Children's Era.\" The Children's Era! This makes me think of Ellen Key's book -- The Century of the Child. Ellen Key hoped that this twentieth century was to be the century of the child. The twentieth century, she said, would see this old world of ours converted into a beautiful garden of children. Well, we have already lived through a quarter of this twentieth century. What steps have we taken toward making it the century of the child? So far, very, very few.\n","Why does the Children's Era still remain a dream of the dim and the distant future? Why has so little been accomplished? -- in spite of all our acknowledged love of children, all our generosity, all our good-will, all the enormous spending of millions on philanthropy and charities, all our warm-hearted sentiment, all our incessant activity and social consciousness? Why?\n","Before you can cultivate a garden, you must know something about gardening. You have got to give your seeds a proper soil in which to grow. You have got to give them sunlight and fresh air. You have got to give them space and the opportunity (if they are to lift their flowers to the sun), to strike their roots deep into that soil. And always -- do not forget this -- you have got to fight weeds. You cannot have a garden, if you let weeds overrun it. So, if we want to make this world a garden for children, we must first of all learn the lesson of the gardener.\n","So far we have not been gardeners. We have only been a sort of silly reception committee, a reception committee at the Grand Central Station of life. Trainload after trainload of children are coming in, day and night -- nameless refugees arriving out of the Nowhere into the Here. Trainload after trainload -- many unwelcome, unwanted, unprepared for, unknown, without baggage, without passports, most of them without pedigrees. These unlimited hordes of refugees arrive in such numbers that the reception committee is thrown into a panic -- a panic of activity. The reception committee arouses itself heroically, establishes emergency measures: milk stations, maternity centers, settlement houses, playgrounds, orphanages, welfare leagues, and every conceivable kind of charitable effort. But still trainloads of children keep on coming -- human weed crop up that spread so fast in this sinister struggle for existence, that the overworked committee becomes exhausted, inefficient, and can think of no way out.\n","When we protest against this immeasurable, meaningless waste of motherhood and child-life; when we protest against the ever-mounting cost to the world of asylums, prisons, homes for the feeble-minded, and such institutions for the unfit, when we protest against the disorder and chaos and tragedy of modern life, when we point out the biological corruption that is destroying the very heart of American life, we are told that we are making merely an \"emotional\" appeal. When we point the one immediate practical way toward order and beauty in society, the only way to lay the foundations of a society composed of happy children, happy women, and happy men, they call this idea indecent and immoral.\n","It is not enough to clean up the filth and disorder of our overcrowded cities. It is not enough to stop the evil of Child Labor -- even if we could! It is not enough to decrease the rate of infantile mortality. It is not enough to open playgrounds, and build more public schools in which we can standardize the mind of the young. It is not enough to throw millions upon millions of dollars into charities and philanthropies. Don't deceive ourselves that by so doing we are making the world \"Safe for Children.\"\n","Those of you who have followed the sessions of this Conference must, I am sure, agree with me that the first real stop toward the creation of a Children's Era must lie in providing the conditions of healthy life for children not only before birth but even more imperatively before conception. Human society must protect its children -- yes, but prenatal care is most essential! The child-to-be, as yet not called into being, has rights no less imperative.\n","We have learned in the preceding sessions of this Conference that, if we wish to produce strong and sturdy children, the embryo must grow in a chemically healthy medium. The blood stream of the mother must be chemically normal. Worry, strain, shock, unhappiness, enforced maternity, may all poison the blood of the enslaved mother. This chemically poisoned blood may produce a defective baby -- a child foredoomed to idiocy, or feeble-mindedness, crime, or failure.\n","Do I exaggerate? Am I taking a rare exception and making it a general rule? Our opponents declare that children are conceived in love, and that every new-born baby converts its parents to love and unselfishness. My answer is to point to the asylums, the hospitals, the ever-growing institutions for the unfit. Look into the family history of those who are feeble-minded; or behind the bars of jails and prisons. Trace the family histories; find out the conditions under which they were conceived and born, before you attempt to persuade us that reckless breeding has nothing to do with these grave questions.\n","There is only one way out. We have got to fight for the health and happiness of the Unborn Child. And to do that in a practical, tangible way, we have got to free women from enforced, enslaved maternity. There can be no hope for the future of civilization, no certainty of racial salvation, until every woman can decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother, and when and how many children she cares to bring into the world. That is the first step.\n","I would like to suggest Civil Service examinations for parenthood! Prospective parents after such an examination would be given a parenthood license, proving that they are physically and mentally fit to be the fathers and mothers of the next generation.\n","This is an interesting idea -- but then arises the questions \"Who is to decide?\" \"Would there be a jury, like a play jury?\" Would a Republican administration give parenthood permits only to Republicans -- or perhaps only to Democrats? The more you think of governmental interference, the less it works out. Take this plan of civil service examination for parenthood. It suggests Prohibition: there might even be bootlegging in babies!\n","No, I doubt the advisability of governmental sanction. The problem of bringing children into the world ought to be decided by those most seriously involved -- those who run the greatest risks; in the last analysis -- by the mother and the child. If there is going to be any Civil Service examination, let it be conducted by the Unborn Child, the Child-to-be.\n","Just try for a moment to picture the possibilities of such an examination. When you want a cook or housemaid, you go to an employment bureau. You have to answer questions. You have to exchange references. You have to persuade the talented cook that you conduct a proper well-run household. Children ought to have at least the same privilege as cooks.\n","Sometimes in idle moments I like to think it would be a very good scheme to have a bureau of the Child-to-be. At such a bureau of the unborn, the wise child might be able to find out a few things about its father -- and its mother. Just think for a moment of this bureau where prospective parents might apply for a baby. Think of the questions they would be asked by the agent of the unborn or by the baby itself.\n","First: \"Mr. Father, a baby is an expensive luxury. Can you really afford one?\"\n","\"Have you paid for your last baby yet?\"\n","\"How many children have you already? Six? You must have your hands full. Can you take care of so many?\"\n","\"Do you look upon children as a reward -- or a penalty?\"\n","\"How are you ductless glands -- well balanced?\"\n","Can you provide a happy home for one! A sunny nursery? Proper food?\"\n","\"What's that you say? Ten children already? Two dark rooms in the slums?\"\n","\"No, thank you! I don't care to be born at all if I cannot be well-born. Good-bye!\"\n","And if we could organize a society for the prevention of cruelty to unborn children, we would make it a law that children should be brought into the world only when they were welcome, invited, and wanted; that they would arrive with a clean bill of health and heritage; that they would possess healthy, happy, well-mated, and mature parents.\n","And there would be certain conditions of circumstances which would preclude parenthood. These conditions, the presence of which would make parenthood a crime, are the following:\n","1. Transmissible disease\n","2. Temporary disease\n","3. Subnormal children already in the family\n","4. Space out between births\n","5. Twenty-three years as a minimum age for parents\n","6. Economic circumstances adequate\n","7. Spiritual harmony between parents.\n","In conclusion, let me repeat: We are not trying to establish a dictatorship over parents. We want to free women from enslavery and unwilling motherhood. We are fighting for the emancipation for the mothers of the world, of the children of the world, and the children to be. We want to create a real Century of the Child -- usher in a Children's Era. We can do this by handling the terrific gift of life in bodies fit and perfect as can be fashioned. Help us to make this Conference, which as aroused so much interest, the turning point toward this era. Only so can you help in the creation of the future. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," \"the children's Era\" is a book about the century of the child. the 20th century would see this old world of ours converted into beautiful garden of children, she says. why has so little been accomplished? \"we have not been gardeners,\" he says, but we have only been silly reception committees at the Grand Central Station of life. \"you have got to fight weeds.\" --------------------------\n","645 \n","Original text: If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.

I thought I had left it also to lay to rest his restless dream of Philippine freedom. Today, I have returned as the President of a free people.\n","In burying Ninoy, a whole nation honored him. By that brave and selfless act of giving honor, a nation in shame recovered its own. A country that had lost faith in its future, found it in a faithless and brazen act of murder.\n","So in giving, we receive; in losing, we find; and out of defeat, we snatched our victory. For the nation, Ninoy became the pleasing sacrifice that answered their prayers for freedom. For myself and our children, Ninoy was a loving husband and father. His loss, three times in our lives, was always a deep and painful one.\n","Fourteen years ago this month, was the first time we lost him. A President-turned-dictator, and traitor to his oath suspended the Constitution and shut down the Congress that was much like this one, before which I am honored to speak. He detained my husband along with thousands of others; senators, publishers and anyone who had spoken up for the democracy as its end drew near. But for Ninoy, a long and cruel ordeal was reserved. The dictator already knew that Ninoy was not a body merely to be imprisoned, but a spirit he must break. For even as the dictatorship demolished one by one, the institutions of democracy, the press, the Congress, the independence of the judiciary, the protection of the Bill of Rights, Ninoy kept their spirit alive in himself.\n","The government sought to break him by indignities and terror. They locked him up in a tiny, nearly airless cell in a military camp in the north. They stripped him naked and held the threat of a sudden midnight execution over his head. Ninoy held up manfully under all of it. I barely did, as well.\n","For 43 days, the authorities would not tell me what had happened to him. This was the first time my children and I felt we had lost him. When that didn’t work, they put him on trial for subversion, murder, and a host of other crimes before a military commission. Ninoy challenged its authority, and went on a fast. If he survived it, then he felt God intended him for another fate.\n","We had lost him, again. For nothing would hold him back from his determination to see his fast through to the end. He stopped only when it dawned on him that the government would keep his body alive after the fast had destroyed his brain. And so, with barely any life in his body, he called off the fast on the 40th day. God meant him for other things, he felt. He did not know that an early death would still be his fate; that only the timing was wrong.\n","At any time during his long ordeal, Ninoy could have made a separate peace with a dictatorship as so many of his countrymen had done. But the spirit of democracy that inheres in our race and animates this chamber could not be allowed to die. He held out in the loneliness of his cell, and the frustration of exile, the democratic alternative to the insatiable greed and mindless cruelty of the right, and the purging holocaust of the left.\n","And then, we lost him irrevocably, and more painfully than in the past. The news came to us in Boston. It had to be after the three happiest years of our lives together, but his death was my country’s resurrection, and the courage and faith by which alone, they could be free again. The dictator had called him a nobody, yet two million people threw aside their passivity and fear, and escorted him to his grave.\n","And so began the revolution that has brought me to democracy’s most famous home; the Congress of the United States.\n","I held fast to Ninoy’s conviction that it must be by the ways of democracy. I held out for participation in the 1984 election the dictatorship called, even if I knew it would be rigged. I was warned by the lawyers of the opposition that I ran the grave risk of legitimizing the forgone results of elections that were clearly going to be fraudulent.\n","But I was not fighting for lawyers, but for the people in whose intelligence I had implicit faith. By the exercise of democracy, even in a dictatorship, they would be prepared for democracy when it came. And then also, it was the only way I knew by which we could measure our power, even in the terms dictated by the dictatorship.\n","The people vindicated me in an election shamefully marked by government thuggery and fraud. The opposition swept the elections, garnering a clear majority of the votes, even if they ended up, thanks to a corrupt commission on elections, with barely a third of the seats in Parliament. Now I knew our power.\n","Last year, in an excess of arrogance, the dictatorship called for its doom in a snap election. The people obliged. With over a million signatures, they drafted me to challenge the dictatorship, and I obliged.\n","The rest is the history that dramatically unfolded on your television screens and across the front pages of your newspapers.\n","You saw a nation armed with courage and integrity, stand fast by democracy against threats and corruption.\n","You saw women poll watchers break out in tears as armed goons crashed the polling places to steal the ballots. But just the same, they tied themselves to the ballot boxes.\n","You saw a people so committed to the ways of democracy that they were prepared to give their lives for its pale imitation.\n","At the end of the day, before another wave of fraud could distort the results, I announced the People’s victory. Many of you here today, played a part in changing the policy of your country towards ours.\n","We, the Filipinos, thank each of you for what you did -- for, balancing America’s strategic interest against human concerns illuminates the American vision of the world.\n","The Co-Chairman of the United States Observer Team, in his report to the President, said:\n","I was witness to an extraordinary manifestation of democracy on the part of the Filipino people. The ultimate result was the election of Mrs. Corazon Aquino as President, and Mr. Salvador Laurel as Vice President of the Philippines.\n","When a subservient Parliament announced my opponent’s victory, the people then turned out in the streets, and proclaimed me the President of all the people. And true to their word, when a handful of military leaders declared themselves against the dictatorship, the people rallied to their protection.\n","Surely, the people take care of their own. It is on that faith and the obligation it entails that I assumed the Presidency. As I came to power peacefully, so shall I keep it. That is my contract with my people and my commitment to God.\n","He had willed that the blood drawn with the lash, shall not, in my country, be paid by blood, drawn by the sword, but by the tearful joy of reconciliation. We have swept away absolute power by a limited revolution that respected the life and freedom of every Filipino. Now we are restoring full constitutional government. Again, as we restore democracy by the ways of democracy, so are we completing the constitutional structures of our new democracy under a Constitution that already gives full respect to the Bill of Rights.\n","A jealously independent constitutional commission is completing its draft which will be submitted later this year to a popular referendum. When it is approved, there will be elections for both national and local positions. So within about a year from a peaceful but national upheaval that overturned a dictatorship, we shall have returned to full constitutional government.\n","Given the polarization and breakdown we inherited, this is no small achievement. My predecessor set aside democracy to save it from a communist insurgency that numbered less than 500. Unhampered by respect for human rights, he went at it with hammer and tongs. By the time he fled, that insurgency had grown to more than 16,000.\n","I think there is a lesson here to be learned about trying to stifle a thing with a means by which it grows. I don’t think -- I don’t think anybody in or outside our country, concerned for a democratic and open Philippines, doubts what must be done. Through political initiatives and local reintegration programs, we must seek to bring the insurgents down from the hills, and by economic progress and justice, show them that which the best intentioned among them, fight.\n","As President of all my people, I will not betray the cause of peace by which I came to power.\n","Yet equally and again, no friend of Filipino democracy will challenge this. I will not stand by and allow an insurgent leadership to spurn our offer of peace and kill our young soldiers and threaten our new freedom.\n","Yet, I must explore the path of peace to the utmost. For at its end, whatever disappointment I meet there, is the moral basis for laying down the olive branch of peace and taking up the sword of war. Still, should it come to that, I will not waiver from the course laid down by your great liberator:\n","Like Abraham Lincoln, I understand that force may be necessary before mercy. Like Lincoln, I don’t relish it. Yet, I will do whatever it takes to defend the integrity and freedom of my country.\n","Finally, may I turn to that other slavery, our 26 billion dollar foreign debt? I have said that we shall honor it. Yet the means by which we shall be able to do so, are kept from us. Many of the conditions imposed on the previous government that stole this debt, continue to be imposed on us, who never benefitted from it. And no assistance or liberality, commensurate with a calamity that was visited on us, has been extended. Yet, ours must have been the cheapest revolution, ever.\n","With little help from others, we Filipinos fulfilled the first and most difficult condition of the debt negotiation: the full restoration of democracy and responsible government. Elsewhere, and in other times of more stringent world economic conditions, marshal plans and their like, were felt to be necessary companions of returning democracy.\n","When I met with President Reagan, we began an important dialogue about cooperation and the strengthening of friendship between our two countries. That meeting was both a confirmation and a new beginning. I am sure it will lead to positive results in all areas of common concern.\n","Today, we face the aspiration of a people who had known so much poverty and massive unemployment for the past 14 years, and yet offer their lives for the abstraction of democracy. Wherever I went in the campaign, slum area or impoverished village, they came to me with one cry: Democracy.\n","Not food, although they clearly needed it, but democracy. Not work, although they surely wanted it, but democracy. Not money, for they gave what little they had to my campaign. They didn’t expect me to work a miracle that would instantly put food into their mouths, clothes on their back, education in their children, and give them work that will put dignity in their lives.\n","But I feel the pressing obligation to respond quickly as the leader of a people, so deserving of all these things. We face a communist insurgency that feeds on economic deterioration. Even as we carry a great share of the free world defenses in the Pacific, these are only two of the many burdens my people carry.\n","Even as they try to build a worthy and enduring house for their new democracy that may serve as well as a redoubt for freedom in Asia. Yet, no sooner is one stone laid, than two are taken away. Half our export earnings, 2 billion dollars out of 4 billion dollars which is all we can earn in the restrictive markets of the world, must go to pay just the interest on a debt, whose benefit the Filipino people never received.\n","Still we fought for honor and if only for honor, we shall pay. And yet, should we have to wring the payments from the sweat of our men’s faces, and thank all the wealth piled up by the bondsman’s two hundred fifty years of unrequited toil?\n","Yet, to all Americans, as the leader of a proud and free people, I address this question: has there been a greater test of national commitment to the ideals you hold dear, than that my people have gone through? You have spent many lives and much treasure to bring freedom to many lands that were reluctant to receive it, and here you have a people who won it by themselves, and need only the help to preserve it.\n","Three years ago I said, “Thank you, America, for the haven from oppression and the home you gave Ninoy, myself and our children, and for the three happiest years of our lives together.” Today I say, join us, America, as we build a new home for democracy, another haven for the oppressed, so it may stand as a shining testament of our two nations' commitment to freedom. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," in burying his husband, a nation in shame recovered its own. the dictator knew that Ninoy was not merely to be imprisoned, but an spirit he must break, says robert mccartney - who was convicted of subversion, murder, and other crimes in the u.s. she says the government tried to break him by indignities and terror; they locked him up in an air --------------------------\n","647 \n","Original text: My fellow Americans:\n","Last night, when I spoke with you about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that troops of the United States and our allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater operation. It has come to pass with success thus far.\n","And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in prayer.\n","Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.\n","Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.\n","They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces.

The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the violences of war.\n","For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise, and tolerance, and good will among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the haven of home.\n","Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a continuance of prayer.

But well into this century, the United States was still paying out pensions to the heirs of Civil War soldiers. We honor treaties that date back some 200 years, despite no one being alive who signed those treaties. Many of us would love to be taxed for the things we are solely and individually responsible for. But we are American citizens, and thus bound to a collective enterprise that extends beyond our individual and personal reach.\n","It would seem ridiculous to dispute invocations of the Founders, or the Greatest Generation, on the basis of lack of membership in either group. We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance; and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance.\n","Coleman Hughes -- Opening Statement to Congress on Slavery Reparations\n","It is tempting to divorce this modern campaign of terror, of plunder, from enslavement. But the logic of enslavement, of white supremacy, respects no such borders, and the god of bondage was lustful and begat many heirs: coup d’états and convict leasing, vagrancy laws and debt peonage [or debt bondage], redlining and racist GI bills, poll taxes and state -- state-sponsored terrorism.\n","We grant that Mr. McConnell was not alive for Appomattox, but he was alive for the electrocution of George Stinney. He was alive for the blinding of Isaac Woodard. He was alive to witness kleptocracy in his native Alabama and a regime premised on electoral theft. Majority Leader McConnell cited civil rights legislation yesterday, as well he should, because he was alive to witness the harassment, jailing, and betrayal of those responsible for that legislation by a government sworn to protect them. He was alive for the redlining of Chicago and the looting of black homeowners of some four billion dollars. Victims of that plunder are very much alive today. I am sure they’d love a word with the majority leader.\n","What they know, what this committee must know, is that while emancipation dead-bolted the door against the bandits of America, Jim Crow wedged the windows wide open. And that is the thing about Senator McConnell’s \"something.\" It was 150 years ago. And it was right now.\n","The typical black family in this country has one-tenth the wealth of the typical white family. Black women die in childbirth at four times the rate of white women. And there is, of course, the shame of this land of the free boasting the largest prison population on the planet, of which the descendants of the enslaved make up the largest share.\n","The matter of reparations is one of making amends and direct redress, but it is also a question of citizenship. In H.R. 40, this body has a chance to both make good on its 2009 apology for enslavement and reject fair-weather patriotism, to say that a nation is both its credits and its debits; that if Thomas Jefferson matters, so does Sally Hemings; that if D-Day matters, so does Black Wall Street; that if Valley Forge matters, so does Fort Pillow; because the question really is not whether we will be tied to the somethings of our past, but whether we are courageous enough to be tied to the whole of them.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," we honor treaties that date back 200 years, despite no one being alive. eric liu: we recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is that of inheritance. it's tempting to divorce this modern campaign of terror, of plunder, from enslavement. --------------------------\n","649 \n","Original text: Thank you very much for those kind and generous words.\n","Libraries today face an unprecedented challenge of preserving memory, activating intellect, and serving the public agenda in an age that is in many ways present-minded, spectator-oriented, and self-indulgent; and in a culture which has tended, oftentimes one might add, to in a sense take libraries for granted as part of the landscape rather than to let their realities and their possibilities feed the imagination for what they might do.\n","Now, the Library of Congress is not just the largest -- as has been already said of the Library -- it's the most diverse and the most accessible repository of human knowledge in the history of the world. And it's an important but still partially undiscovered national asset for dealing with some of these problems that are bearing in on us -- bearing in on us, I think, from three concentric circles. It's a place of opportunity, therefore, for responding to the key problems pressing in on us today from these three universes that are moving in on us -- the world, the nation, and this city of government itself.\n","It's a reservoir of knowledge that is quite simply a unique instrument for both competing with and understanding better the rest of the world. It's 86 million items now and -- I regret to tell you -- with 31,000 arriving a day, you can see how it builds up fairly rapidly, in all languages and all media. We're currently collecting in more than 450 languages. It houses larger Hispanic American and Arab collections, for instance, than exist in either Latin America or the Arab world. It possesses the largest Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Polish -- you name it -- collections anywhere outside those countries (outside those countries where those languages are spoken). And it provides, as well, the world's largest collection of maps, documentary photographs, sheet music, movies, and much else.\n","Now, to appreciate the global reach, not just the richness of contents, of this unique and not very fully understood institution, just consider with me for a minute some of its activities with respect to just one country that the introducer has mentioned, the Soviet Union, within just one recent period of about a half year.\n","At the Washington Summit in December 1987, Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev asked to see a work on the USSR done by the Library's Congressional Research Service while his arms negotiator was independently meeting with the author of another such work from the CRS.\n","In late January 1988, the Library of Congress officials participated in a unique international scholarly conference in Leningrad that opened the Russian churches celebration of its millennium last year, and at the same time laid the groundwork for the Library of Congress’ own exhibit -- exhibition and conference on the same subject in the spring here in Washington.\n","In February, the largest library disaster of modern times destroyed or damaged four million volumes of Russia's original vehicle for intellectual westernization, the priceless Academy of Sciences Library in Leningrad. [The] Library of Congress immediately sent two delegations, saved many books by persuading the Soviets to use vacuum freeze drying for 210,000 volumes and to use phased conservation techniques for saving 180,000 foreign language volumes. We have since signed a protocol so that the Library of Congress is now formally the principal coordinator of an international replacement and recovery effort.\n","President Reagan, speaking at Moscow University -- Gorbachev's alma mater -- during the Moscow Summit in June presented to its library the first major primary materials for studying American history ever made available to undergraduates there -- microfilms from the Library of Congress of the complete papers of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln.\n","Shortly thereafter, Soviet journalists and publishers visiting the Library of Congress agreed for the first time to publish American children's books in the Soviet Union in cooperation with the Library's plans, which the Congress and President have since endorsed formally to make this year, 1989, the Year of the Young Reader.\n","Shortly after that, the Library hosted the first bi-national conference ever held between Soviet and American library and information specialists, agreeing then on a bi-national conference next year in Moscow between the Library of Congress and the Lenin Library on the role of libraries in the development of both countries.\n","Many Soviet officials now see open access to knowledge as a key prerequisite that they had not thought about earlier for any serious democratization in that country; and some have even discussed the possibility of linking their national library to a legislature on the model of the Library of Congress in order to get it out from under a ministry which is always more inherently subject to direct police controls.\n","Now, every one of the seven Library of Congress involvements with the USSR in a seven-month period that I have just itemized -- every one came from a different part of the Library: the Congressional Research Service, which is the world's largest public policy think thank; the Office of the Librarian; the Conservation Office; the Manuscript Division, which houses the papers of almost all American Presidents up to Coolidge; the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division; the small center for the Book and Children's Literature; and the large departments of processing and research Services.\n","America’s continuing decline in international and foreign language studies has occurred precisely during a time when we have become as a nation increasingly interdependent with other countries economically, ecologically, and in all kinds of other ways. At a major conference on knowledge and power -- the -- the transcript of which is available for any of you who would like to see it -- last summer, convened by the Library of Congress' Council of Scholars, Secretary of State George Shultz identified the persistence of religious and ethnic particularism as one of the most perplexing and recurrent problems that he encountered during his term of office.\n","The Library of Congress in its current restoration of its glorious [Thomas] Jefferson Building hopes to include reading rooms for all major cultures of the world in that building -- transforming it into a living, universal museum of the written word of all peoples; the closest thing anywhere to the world's memory; the place to find out what is unique about other people, their achievements, their anguish, their aspirations.\n","The Library’s [John] Adams Building, by contrast next to it, is the place for using new modes of data and scientific analysis so that common things can be measured and compared. Our special reading rooms for the social and natural sciences there will, we hope, increasingly aid our international competitiveness. We hope to interest the productive private sector in making fuller use of our little known collection of nearly four million technical and scientific reports, as well as our unmatched ability to render foreign technical literature into English with a staff of more than 100 fluent in Chinese, and the same number --a little more -- in Japanese, and well over 200 fluent in Russian.\n","The Library's own unparalleled foreign languages collections have just been augmented, I am pleased to announce for the first time anywhere today, by the acquisition of the National Translation Center from the University of Chicago. The Center's holdings date from the 1920s and include more than 350,000 complete translations of scientific and technical articles and research papers and bibliographical information on another 600,000 translations. We are excited about the prospect of being able to make this asset available to the nation’s research and development community, perhaps in the context of a broader service of rendering the foreign works of importance into English.\n","But how is this national Library to serve the nation beyond helping -- as I have already mentioned -- that first circle of the world, relating to international understanding and competitiveness? The attempt to answer this question in a nation that has some 115,000 other libraries, and many other private and public institutions dealing with knowledge and information, has been a driving force behind our unprecedented, just completed year-long internal examination of what this Library's mission and strategy should be for its third century, which will begin in the year 2000.\n","For guidelines towards the library of the future, I turn first and foremost to an internal management and planning committee of 27 mid-level members of the Library of Congress staff; but also to members of Congress, to external management consultants, to a national advisory committee of 29 distinguished librarians, publishers, and business people; and to 11 national forums held in different locations all over the country with about 10,000 librarians and interested citizens participate. Now, on the basis of all this and nearly 1,000 written staff suggestions plus oral suggestions from a thousand staff members who attended the 12 open forums I conducted all last year, we slowly agreed on a set of institutional values that define a mission and suggest a new organizational concept towards which we are now actively moving, along with the outlines of some new ways for serving the nation -- that second of those circles around -- around us.\n","This Library has a contribution to make both as leader and partner to the educational process in this country, broadly understood, helping combat not just the illiteracy that is growing alarmingly in this country but also the growing aliteracy of which my predecessor, Dan Bornstein, used to speak -- aliteracy being those who can read but rarely do; and finally, also, the tendency, even among educated people, towards a passive spectatorism, a self-indulgent cynicism which undermines the active intellect and the hopeful spirit which are the two indispensible items to a healthy and improving democracy.\n","The Library's main service to the nation since the beginning of this century has traditionally been providing inexpensive cataloguing for other libraries. But the time has now come to begin also sharing the contents of this Library with the broader community. New technologies make it possible to reproduce key elements of our massive special collections of sights and sounds, as well as instructive and inspirational facsimiles of the unique primary record we have of the American experience at inventing a self-governing constitutional system and making democracy work in a large, modern society.\n","The series will establish American Memory corners, providing local libraries both with exciting new technology that will interest young people not otherwise attracted sometimes to libraries in an audiovisual age, but at the same time will provide solid content that will increase the inventory in local libraries and will raise questions that will lead viewers and readers to the books in the library all around them for further answers, and for further satisfaction of a curiosity that has to be engaged before it can be satisfied.\n","American Memory will quietly increase a present-minded generation’s knowledge of and pride in its own past, and local libraries and schools will be able to build their own teaching materials around what will be permanent enrichments to their library's collections.\n","We believe that this collection will also interest foreigners who are more fascinated than ever with our ongoing experience, as well as the American people, and that it will help them understand us better just as our reinforcement of foreign area studies here in Washington will help us understand them better.\n","The Library also, of course, serves this nation as its reference checker of last resort -- in person, by telephone, or by correspondence. The Library of Congress last year answered nearly three million inquiries -- more than a million from the general public through our various research divisions; nearly a half million from Congress through the Congressional Research Service; another half million to the Copyright Office; and more than 700,000 to the Law Library, which of course includes the world's largest international law library.\n","Well, the task ahead lies in continuing our historically free services to Congress, scholars, and the general public while exploring the possibilities of fee-based services or in-kind contributions from groups in the productive sector whose inventiveness and competitiveness would be greatly advanced by using resources here that they have yet to discover. Getting the champagne into the wine cellar, if you like -- our wine cellar -- then out of the bottle into everybody's six-pack, sharing it through online facts or disc technologies as they come on stream.\n","This Library deals, of course, in movable information and it's thus in an excellent position to help overcome a danger that concerns me, I think, with the general cultural explosion in Washington -- what I would call the \"creeping Versailles syndrome.\" There is a tendency to bring things into Washington to enjoy them here rather than get them out into the nation to benefit the ordinary citizenry; and this is, to some extent, inevitable when you're dealing with artifacts that [are] difficult to move. But we who deal in movable information in the electronic age have special opportunities and, I think, moral obligations to the public to use the new technologies, to share the materials here with those who cannot come here.\n","The last of the three concentric circles that pose special service opportunities for the information systems of the future is this remarkable city of Washington itself. Its rise as a major intellectual center has gone largely unnoticed, unlike the earlier emergence of Washington as a center of artistic and theatrical activity. The growth of public policy think tanks, of humanistic research centers, of scientific research in a city that includes this Library, the National Archives, and other government information centers has made Washington in many ways the information capital of the world as it enters this Information Age. Whole fields of thought flourish almost uniquely in Washington: the aesthetics of power rather than academic political science; political economy rather than university or business econometrics; strategic studies rather than academic international relations; and so forth.\n","But Washington is a city still in which it is easier for genius to visit than to stay; it is easier to write than think. It's a city that is present-minded, adversarially organized, advocacy driven. There is, therefore, a particular need for the objectivity that the Library of Congress and its Congressional Research Service provides, as well as for the independent academic standards of excellence that flourish in this Library and are exemplified by its national academic all-star group, the Council of Scholars, and by such visiting scholars as our most recent one for them, Sir Isaiah Berlin.\n","We would hope to celebrate the life of the mind here the way this city now celebrates the performing and visual arts, and the way the Library already does for poetry and chamber music, for instance. Perhaps we need special honors for those fields in which America excels but the Nobel Committee does not give awards: the humanities and the social sciences. And, indeed it is progress in these that is essential to the very survival, and not merely the enjoyment, of our civilization.\n","This city needs peaks of independent intellectual quality and it needs to honor the intellect. The world and the nation needs [sic] new ideas that will be not produced -- that will not be be produced simply by new money or programs. The soil is needed -- and the soil for new ideas must be fertilized by the kind of freedom and access to the full human record which the Library of Congress uniquely offers.\n","But there's also a need for some inner moral impulse to serve, which I believe our staff has both exemplified and strengthened during the year-long review process we’ve just completed at the Library of Congress. Our planning process began with a three-month discussion of values -- Some people thought that was just an idle exercise or platitudinous one -- but they came up with values which we now recognize as institutional commitments, above all...service and quality, fairness and participation.\n","These produced a service mission that recognizes and builds on the dedication and skill of the public servants who work so hard in our and in other libraries. And it's produced a radically different concept of the way of doing business, away from the traditional paramilitary structure -- which is -- of organization -- which is rigid, hierarchical, and focused on protecting turf inside the organization -- towards a new flexible, participatory, team-oriented system that is focused on expanding service to our constituents outside. It recognizes the breadth and depth of knowledge of the staff and seeks to get them off the 19th century assembly line into the 21st century information network; to see this Library as pivotal players in a continuum of scholarly communication that provides access to the old in order to foster creation of the new.\n","This Library is determined, then, to be both catalyst and participant in the scholarly process, that which transforms information into knowledge and knowledge into wisdom as it seeks to serve the Congress and the nation that has so generously and imaginatively sustained it. [The] Library is organizing exhibitions and programs this year in honor of the 200th anniversary of the United States Congress which created this remarkable intellectual conglomerate shortly after moving the new Capitol to Washington.\n","The Founding Fathers sensed early what others, including many of the Russian visitors we talked to, are just discovering now -- that both a body of knowledge and access to it must aspire towards universality if you are to aspire towards true democracy. The first meeting of the Continental Congress in '74 in Philadelphia occurred in a library building and building the Library of...they debated...borrowing privileges even before they got around to -- to deriving out of all those books just how it was that a free people was going to devise an equitable way of governing themselves.\n","Building the Library of Congress in Washington on Jefferson's example and around his own book collection, the Congress through the years has linked an institution that makes laws for our people with a treasury of learning for all people. And this is surely one of the great and least sung historic accomplishments.\n","The fear of all of us who are its custodians is that it could somehow, someday be lost, eroded -- all manner of ways it could go out -- like the Great Library at Alexandria which was the culminating, really, accomplishment of the ancient world. The great hope is that it may recreate the -- the creativity that prevailed in Alexandria before that terrible fire -- of an Eratosthenes who first measured the earth's circumference; of a Callimachus, the first bibliographer who worked there; and an Erasistratus who discovered the pumping action of the heart.\n","America may have the opportunity -- if it has the heart and the vision and will -- to produce a civilization like that of the Greeks, but perhaps even better because it could be continental, multi-ethnic, and without slavery. But if this is to happen in the Information Age, we will have to bring more of Athens into this particular realm, the frontiers of truth into this center of power. And we will need new private sector Carnegies to reinforce continuing federal support if we are to help share with America and the world a richness that should surely not be confined just to this city.\n","We here in Washington have a unique opportunity to participate in the unending human effort to winnow information into knowledge, to distill that knowledge into wisdom, and to bring it all to bear on the enduring American Dream that whatever our problems are today, tomorrow can still be better than yesterday.\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the library of Congress is the most diverse and most accessible repository of human knowledge in the history of the world. it's an important but still partially undiscovered national asset for dealing with these key problems that are bearing in on us today from three concentric circles. 86 million items now and with 31,000 arriving a day, you can see how it builds up fairly rapidly, in all languages and all media. --------------------------\n","650 \n","Original text: Madam Speaker, as members of Congress we are not here just to vote, but to speak -- to give voice on this floor to the aspirations of our constituents. So this place where we speak -- the well of the House -- is very special to me. When I was a freshman Congressman in 1987, I delivered my first remarks from this podium. Twelve years later in January 6th, 1999, when I was first sworn in as Speaker, I made my acceptance speech from here as well. I explained at the time, that I was breaking the tradition of the Speaker by making an acceptance remarks from the -- not from the Speaker's chair \"because my legislative home is here on the floor with you, and so is my heart.\" Well, my heart is still here and always will be.\n","But the Bible reminds us in the book of Ecclesiastes: \"To everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven.\" And I think that pretty much sums up our existence in this place. So now, after 21 years, in serving the people of Illinois in this House, the time has come for me to make my last speech from this podium. Our Founding Fathers envisioned a citizen legislature and it's time for this legislator to return to be -- being a private citizen.\n","And Madam Speaker, when I was re-elected as Speaker of this House in January of 2003, I was able to congratulate you on being the first woman to be nominated as Speaker. Just four short years later you surpassed that achievement and became the first woman elected as Speaker. And I have to admit that as we went into that 2006 election, I was hoping that you would put off that achievement just a little bit longer. I think all of us in this House, regardless of Party or our affiliation, were proud to be serving when that glass ceiling was shattered.\n","And I'd also like to thank you, Madam Speaker, for the many courtesies that you've shown to me as a former Speaker of this House during the past year, including the opportunity to formally say goodbye to all of my colleagues here today.\n","I will get myself into trouble if I start singling out members in these remarks -- And I owe so much to so many of you -- for your friendship, for the many things that you've taught me and for your support during some very difficult days, such as the aftermath of 9/11 when I became a \"wartime Speaker.\"\n","But I would be remiss if I did not extend a heartfelt \"thank you\" to my colleagues and former colleagues in the Illinois Congressional Delegation and my Freshman Class of 1986. We've accomplished much working together. And I also want to thank my leader, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Boehner, and his fellow Republican leaders who head a vibrant minority -- the largest Republican minority since 1955 -- a minority that is demonstrating to the country that it should -- and I think will -- lead this house again yet someday.\n","More than 25 years ago, when I entered politics, I never envisioned that this former teacher and wrestling coach from Kendall County, Illinois would have the opportunity to lead the United States House of Representatives. It was you, the members of this House, who gave me that opportunity longer than any other member of my party in history -- and I'm grateful to you.\n","Becoming Speaker was a very humbling experience -- an opportunity that only 51 men and one woman have ever had since 1789. I suspect that sitting here in this chamber are several men and women who will some day have the honor to be Speaker of this House. But whether that honor comes your way or not -- you're already the trustee of one of the most wonderful jobs that anyone wanting to serve their country can have. You are a member of the United States House of Representatives, entrusted by more than 700,000 people -- citizens to represent them.\n","Eleven times the voters of the 14th District of Illinois hired me as their representative. It's been a journey that we've traveled together -- and every year brought new challenges. I am proud of so many of the things that I was able to work on over those years: working to make health care more affordable and accessible by creating tax-free health savings accounts; delivering on long-awaited prescription drug coverage for seniors while at the same time modernizing Medicare for the 21st century; passing two of the largest tax relief packages for working Americans in our nation's history, which encouraged Americans to invest and small businesses to grow and to create new jobs; and reducing the unfair social security earnings limit on our senior citizens that needed to work. And back home in Illinois, I was proud to work on environmental issues like the removal of the dangerous thorium tailings from West Chicago Illinois and preserving the vital drinking water supply of the people of the Fox Valley. But ultimately, the most important responsibility for any of us who serve this House is to provide for the defense of this nation. It's our most solemn obligation.\n","On September 11th, 2001, I became a wartime Speaker and together we became a wartime Congress. On that dark day, our Congress was united. We were not Republicans or Democrats -- we were just Americans. We stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the steps of this Capitol and vowed to do whatever was necessary. And in the following days and weeks and months, President Bush, Leader Gephardt, and I worked together.\n","We tried to bind the wounds of those victimized by the attacks. And then made sure it would never happen again. We demanded that our intelligence agencies do a better job of sharing information. Then we gave law enforcement more effective tools and resources to guard against attack. Then we made an unprecedented investment in Homeland Security. And did we get it all right? Of course not. Only hindsight is 20/20. But through those efforts, and the grace of God, we have avoided additional attacks -- attacks on American soil. There's no doubt in my mind that the American people are safer today because of the heroic actions of our men and women who serve our armed services and intelligence agencies, and because of the actions taken here, by our Congress.\n","It's popular these days to ask political figures what mistakes they've made -- where they've failed. As a former history teacher I know such analysis is best tempered by time and reflection, and that is probably best left to others. But I will say this: I continue to worry about the breakdown of civility in our political discourse. I tried my best, but I wish I had been more successful. When I addressed this chamber for the first time as your Speaker, I noted that \"solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness.\" Those words are as true today as they were then. We each have a responsibility to be passionate about the beliefs that is a healthy -- that -- that is healthy government. But we also have a responsibility to be civil, to be open-minded, and to be fair -- to listen to one another -- to listen to one another, to work in good faith to find solutions to the -- the challenges facing this nation. That is why the American people sent us here. They did not send us here just to get re-elected.\n","As Speaker, I served with two Presidents. President Clinton I worked -- and I worked together to fight the flow of drugs from Columbia -- drugs that destroy the lives of our children. And despite our differences on some issues, we were able to find common ground on others. For most of my years as Speaker, President Bush has been our wartime President. I believe history will judge him as a man of courage and foresight, as well as resolve. I must say I was proud to serve by his side and honored to call him a friend.\n","No member of Congress could succeed in serving his or her constituents without the help of a dedicated staff. They often worked long hours and hard days. Many of them gave some of their most productive years to this institution. And I want to thank all of them and each of them for their service. And I also want to thank all of the people who make -- and have made -- this great body function on a daily basis: the Officers of the House, the Capitol Police, the Chaplain, the permanent staff. They are dedicated professionals who I came to appreciate even more during my years as Speaker.\n","I am also blessed to have a family that helped me every day over these twenty-one years: my two sons Josh and Ethan, my daughter-in-law Heidi -- and our newest addition, my grandson, Jack Hastert. And most importantly, I want to thank my wife Jean, who is here in the gallery today. And thank you Jean for the love and the help that you have given me.\n","In 2003, during the Cannon Centenary Conference on the changing nature of the speakership, I said that \"at the end of the day, the Speaker of the House is really just the person who stands up for the American people.\" That is the same role that every man and woman who serves here should play. Our founders dreamed of a nation, a nation empowered by freedom, where citizens would find justice, where hard working men and women would find economic opportunity. Each of us who comes to this place has different ideas of how to preserve and enhance that dream. It's on this floor of this House where those ideas clash -- peacefully -- and through that struggle our democracy is renewed.\n","Never lose sight of the fact that you participate in the greatest ongoing democratic ritual in the world. We are, as President Reagan often reminded us, \"A Shining City on a Hill.\" Always be mindful of your duties to your constituents and be respectful of the traditions of this institution.\n","I pray that God will give you and guide you in all that you do in these halls; that He gives you the knowledge to do -- to do the people's work, the strength to persevere, and the wisdom to know when to listen to what others have to say.\n","And Madam Speaker, there's a tradition among Olympic wrestlers that you leave your shoes on the mat after your last match.

I am overwhelmed, as a matter of fact, and I am rather fearful of my inability to maintain such a high rating as you've been generous enough to accord to me. In these historic and lovely surroundings, this perfect day, and this very wonderful assembly, it is a tremendously impressive thing to an individual in my position.\n","But to speak more seriously, I need not tell you that the world situation is very serious. That must be apparent to all intelligent people. I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. Furthermore, the people of this country are distant from the troubled areas of the earth, and it is hard for them to comprehend the plight and consequent reactions of the long-suffering peoples of Europe and the effect of those reactions on their governments in connection with our efforts to promote peace in the world.\n","In considering the requirements for the rehabilitation of Europe, the physical loss of life, the visible destruction of cities, factories, mines, and railroads was correctly estimated, but it has become obvious during recent months that this visible destruction was probably less serious than the dislocation of the entire fabric of European economy. For the past ten years conditions have been highly abnormal. The feverish preparation for war and the more feverish maintenance of the war effort engulfed all aspects of national economies. Machinery has fallen into disrepair or is entirely obsolete. Under the arbitrary and destructive Nazi rule, virtually every possible enterprise was geared into the German war machine. Long-standing commercial ties, private institutions, banks, insurance companies, and shipping companies disappeared through loss of capital, absorption through nationalization, or by simple destruction. In many countries, confidence in the local currency has been severely shaken.\n","The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete. Recovery has been seriously retarded by the fact that two years after the close of hostilities a peace settlement with Germany and Austria has not been agreed upon. But even given a more prompt solution of these difficult problems, the rehabilitation of the economic structure of Europe quite evidently will require a much longer time and greater effort than had been foreseen.\n","There is a phase of this matter which is both interesting and serious. The farmer has always produced the foodstuffs to exchange with the city dweller for the other necessities of life. This division of labor is the basis of modern civilization. At the present time it is threatened with breakdown. The town and city industries are not producing adequate goods to exchange with the food-producing farmer. Raw materials and fuel are in short supply.\n","Machinery, as I have said, is lacking or worn out. The farmer or the peasant cannot find the goods for sale which he desires to purchase. So the sale of his farm produce for money which he cannot use seems to him an unprofitable transaction. He, therefore, has withdrawn many fields from crop cultivation and he's using them for grazing. He feeds more grain to stock and finds for himself and his family an ample supply of food, however short he may be on clothing and the other ordinary gadgets of civilization.\n","Meanwhile, people in the cities are short of food and fuel, and in some places approaching the starvation levels. So, the governments are forced to use their foreign money and credits to procure these necessities abroad. This process exhausts funds which are urgently needed for reconstruction.\n","Thus, a very serious situation is rapidly developing which bodes no good for the world. The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down. The truth of the matter is that Europe's requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products -- principally from America -- are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or face economic, social, and political deterioration of a very grave character.\n","The remedy seems to lie in breaking the vicious circle and restoring the confidence of the people of Europe in the economic future of their own countries and of Europe as a whole. The manufacturer and the farmer throughout wide areas must be able and willing to exchange their product for currencies, the continuing value of which is not open to question.\n","Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.\n","Such assistance, I am convinced, must not be on a piecemeal basis, as various crises develop. Any assistance that this Government may render in the future should provide a cure rather than a mere palliative. Any government that is willing to assist in the task of recovery will find full cooperation, I am sure, on the part of the United States Government. Any government which maneuvers to block the recovery of other countries cannot expect help from us. Furthermore, governments, political parties, or groups which seek to perpetuate human misery in order to profit there from politically or otherwise will encounter the opposition of the United States.\n","It is already evident that before the United States Government can proceed much further in its efforts to alleviate the situation and help start the European world on its way to recovery, there must be some agreement among the countries of Europe as to the requirements of the situation and the part those countries themselves will take in order to give a proper effect to whatever actions might be undertaken by this Government. It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for our Government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically. This is the business of the Europeans. The initiative, I think, must come from Europe. The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical for us to do so. The program should be a joint one, agreed to by a number, if not all, European nations.\n","An essential part of any successful action on the part of the United States is an understanding on the part of the people of America of the character of the problem and the remedies to be applied. Political passion and prejudice should have no part. With foresight, and a willingness on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our country, the difficulties I have outlined can and will be overcome.\n","I am sorry that on each occasion I have said something publicly in regard to our international situation, I have been forced by the necessities of the case to enter into rather technical discussions. But, to my mind, it is of vast importance that our people reach some general understanding of what the complications really are, rather than react from a passion or a prejudice or an emotion of the moment.\n","As I said more formally a moment ago, we are remote from the scene of these troubles. It is virtually impossible at this distance merely by reading, or listening, or even seeing photographs and motion pictures, to grasp at all the real significance of the situation. And yet the whole world of the future hangs on a proper judgment. It hangs, I think, to a large extent on the realization of the American people, of just what are the various dominant factors. What are the reactions of the people? What are the justifications of those reactions? What are the sufferings? What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done?\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the world situation is very serious, says dr. conant. he says it's hard for the people of this country to comprehend the plight and consequent reactions of the long-suffering peoples of Europe and the effect of those reactions on their governments in connection with our efforts to promote peace in our world. in the past ten years conditions have been highly abnormal. the feverish preparation for war engulfed all aspects of national economies. --------------------------\n","652 \n","Original text: Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Mattis will make a statement and then take two questions.\n","SecDef Mattis: Yes, ma'am.\n","Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentleman.\n","I just completed the defense ministerial, where I had the opportunity to engage in a bilateral discussion as well with a number of our fellow ministers, in there. We all took part in a dinner last night, reaffirming our strong transatlantic bond, and it's as strong as I have ever seen it. I have some experience here at NATO, and I was impressed by how strong the bond is.\n","My intent was to affirm the full U.S. commitment to NATO and to gain an updated appreciation of the situation facing our alliance. The burden- sharing message I delivered was expected, and it was very well received. And I depart confident that the alliance will be unified in meeting today's security challenges. I especially appreciate the leadership of Secretary General Stoltenberg and the clear alignment of our messages, as well as the messages delivered by so many of the unified alliance member nations and their ministers of defense.\n","In our meetings we discussed in detail the strategic situation facing the alliance. Many allies, including Minister von der Leyen of Germany, recognized 2014 as a watershed year that awakened allies to a new reality.\n","We thoroughly discussed the increased threats facing our alliance. And unified by the threats to our democracies, I found strong alliance resolve to address these growing threats. Russia's aggressive actions have violated international law and are destabilizing.\n","Terrorism emanating from the Middle East and North Africa is a direct and immediate threat to Europe and to us all. I am mindful of the tragic attacks on our European allies and what they have suffered in Paris, Nice, Berlin, Istanbul, and right here in Brussels. And the list, as you know, goes on.\n","We recognize as well that the imposition of instability has taken on new forms that we must now address, for example, in the cyber domain. In response to these threats, NATO is reinforcing deterrence and defense, and adapting to more directly address terrorist threats along our southern flank from the Mediterranean to Turkey; and in the words of the Turkish MOD, a seamless defense from the Kola Peninsula all the way down to the Mideast and across the Mediterranean.\n","We also met with one of NATO's closest partners, Georgia. And I expressed appreciation and respect for Georgia's contributions and sacrifices on NATO's battlefields in Afghanistan.\n","The alliance faces not only these strategic realities, but also political realities. I depart here confident that we have an appreciation of the burden sharing that we must all sustain for deterrence, peace, and prosperity. I am optimistic the alliance will adopt a plan this year, including milestone dates to make steady progress toward meeting defense commitments in light of the increased threats that we all agree that we face.\n","It is imperative that we do so to confront the threats as outlined by the ministers of defense over the last two days. Those means -- Those nations already committing two percent of GDP for defense, and the commitments other allies have made to commit the two percent, give me the confidence that nothing can shake our unity and our commitment to defend our way of life.\n","We specifically appreciate Estonia, Greece, Poland, and the United Kingdom, who have already met the two percent defense spending commitment. These countries are leading by example, making real sacrifices. All allies recognize that they are benefiting from the best defense in the world, so I'm optimistic that all nations are on a steady path to reach the level of commitments made at the Wales and Warsaw summits.\n","Ladies and gentlemen, the Trans-Atlantic bond built on common values remains very, very strong. I see here in Brussels a quickened purpose in this alliance and a profound determination to stand together and honor our commitments to each other. I have confidence that we will sustain the legacy we've inherited and do what is necessary to defend our freedoms. So, thank you very much. I'm happy to take your questions.\n","Moderator: Jennifer Griffin, Fox News.\n","Question: Thank you, sir.\n","What does Russia need to stop doing in order for the U.S. to work with it? The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is meeting with his Russian counterpart for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine. Can you trust the Russians?\n","SecDef Mattis: Jennifer, I think the -- the point about Russia is they have to live by international law just like we expect all mature nations on this planet to do. And what we will do is we will engage politically. We do not -- or, are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward where Russia, living up to its commitments, will return to a -- a partnership of sorts here with NATO. But Russia is going to have to prove itself first and live up the commitments they have made in the Russia-NATO agreement.\n","Question: And just to clarify, do you believe that the Russians interfered in the U.S. elections?\n","SecDef Mattis: Right now I would just say there's very little doubt that they have either interfered or they have attempted to interfere in a number of elections in the democracies.\n","Moderator: Okay. Heidi Jensen, from Jyllands-Posten.\n","Question: Heidi Jensen, Jyllands-Posten, Denmark.\n","You said yesterday that the U.S. would think about moderating its commitment to NATO if the European members of the alliance didn't increase its defense budgets. What -- What does that mean, exactly? Does that mean that the rock solid support for the Article 5 doesn't necessarily stand? Or that you will withdraw troops from Europe or -- could you elaborate on that? Thank you.\n","SecDef Mattis: The commitment to Article 5 remains rock solid. The message that I brought here about everyone carrying their fair share of the burden, the sacrifice to maintain the best defense in the world, was very well received. It was -- It was not contentious. There was no argument. There was simply discussion about how best and how fast can each nation with its own particular circumstance reach it. I leave here very optimistic.\n","We'll take one more question, just to show that I'm boss [sportively delivered].\n","Moderator: Okay.\n","SecDef Mattis: Go ahead.\n","Moderator: Helene, from New York Times.\n","Question: Can we have a question here?\n","Moderator: Sorry.\n","Question: Thank you, sir. Russian Defense Minister Shoygu took issue with your remarks yesterday and said that if the -- NATO wants to deal with Russia from a position of strength then...there's nothing to talk about. Could you respond to that? And, separately, have you requested help from allies for the counter-ISIL fight? And do you think that you need to send additional American troops to Syria?\n","SecDef Mattis: I have no need to respond to the Russian statement at all. NATO has always stood for military strength in protection of the democracies and the freedoms we intend to pass on to our children. But you asked two questions, you know. You just can't -- You just can't keep you journalists down, can we?\n","I don't know. I -- I think -- I think you'd have to ask that question of some others in order to get a full answer. It's just not one that I'd be comfortable answering on my own at this point.\n","Question: Meaning that --\n","Moderator: Okay.\n","Question: -- you're considering it but you haven't decided?\n","SecDef Mattis: Right now, I first want to talk to the other allies and we'll decide where we're going. I'm going to fly from here into the Middle East, and I'm not comfortable answering it yet. Once we know what we have for a mutual appreciation of the situation, then we'll go [forward]. But I'm not comfortable answering it yet.\n","Again, I -- I consider myself a couple weeks into office. First I need to get current, Helene. And once I get current, and once I get allies' assumptions, appreciations for the situation, we'll carve out where we want to go. And at that point I can give you a much more studied answer. Right now I'd -- I'd be concerned with giving you a kind of a half-baked one. We -- We got to take at least one more non-American now, because we've got two -- we need to have -- yes, ma'am.\n","Moderator: The woman in the fourth row, please.\n","Question: Yes, this is from Danish Television. Sir, could you please elaborate a little more about the word moderate?\n","SecDef Mattis: Yeah, no, I'd -- I'd prefer not to, ma'am, because basically that is the headline I do not anticipate ever seeing. By putting it out there, by being very honest among friends, we say this is a -- a burden that we all have to carry equally; and by being persuasive there, you write -- we will write our own headlines as a unified alliance that will stand up for each other. And I'm very confident that we will not have to have that. And sometimes you say the things you don't want to have happen so that you head them off. But thank you.\n","Moderator: And thank --\n","SecDef Mattis: Thank you, ladies and gentleman. I don't think I'm going to get ahead of these ladies here, so I'm going to give up while I'm only somewhat behind. But thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," we all took part in a dinner last night, reaffirming our strong transatlantic bond. the burden-sharing message I delivered was expected, and it was very well received. and I depart confident that the alliance will be unified in meeting today's security challenges. --------------------------\n","653 \n","Original text: Mr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens:\n","I am honored by the support of this convention for Vice President of the United States.\n","I accept the duty to help lead our nation out of a jobs crisis and back to prosperity -- and I know we can do this.\n","I accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old -- and I know that we are ready.\n","Our nominee is sure ready.\n","His whole life -- His whole life prepared him for this moment -- to meet serious challenges in a serious way without excuses and idle words. After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney.\n","I'm the newcomer to this campaign; so let me share a first impression. I have never seen opponents so silent about their record -- and so desperate to keep their power. They've run out of ideas. Their moment came and went. Fear and division is all they've got left.\n","With all their attack ads, the President is just throwing away money -- and he's pretty experienced at that. You see, some people can't be dragged down by the usual cheap tactics, because their character, ability, and plain decency are so obvious -- and ladies and gentlemen, that is Mitt Romney.\n","For my part, your nomination is an unexpected turn. It certainly came as news to my family, and I'd like you to meet them: My best friend and wife Janna; our daughter, Liza; and our boys, Charlie and Sam. The kids are happy to see their grandma, who lives in Florida. There she is -- my mom, Betty.\n","My dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I like to think he'd be proud of me and my sister and brothers. You know what? I'm sure proud of him and of where I come from, Janesville, Wisconsin.\n","I live on the same block where I grew up. We belong to the same parish where I was baptized. Janesville is that kind of place. The people of Wisconsin have been good to me. I've tried to live up to their trust. And now I ask those hardworking men and women and millions like them across America to join our cause and get this country working again.\n","When Governor Romney asked me to join the ticket, I said, \"Let's get this done.\" And that is exactly what we are going to do.\n","President Barack Obama came to office during an economic crisis, as he has reminded us a time or two. Those were very tough days and any fair measure of his record has to take that into account.\n","My home state voted for President Obama. When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: \"I believe that if our government is there to support you...this plant will be here for another hundred years.\"\n","That's what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that's how it is in so many towns, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight.\n","Right now, 23 million men and women are struggling to find work. Twenty-three million people -- unemployed or underemployed. Nearly one in six Americans is in poverty. Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for -- or any work at all.\n","So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?\n","The first troubling sign came with the stimulus. It was President Obama's first and best shot at fixing the economy at a time when he -- he got everything he wanted under one-party rule. It cost 831 billion dollars -- the largest one-time expenditure ever by our federal government.\n","It went to companies like Solyndra, with their gold-plated connections, subsidized jobs, and make-believe markets. The stimulus was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare, and cronyism at their worst. You -- You, the American working people of this country were cut out of the deal. What did taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted. It was borrowed, spent, and wasted.\n","Maybe the greatest waste of all was time. Here we were, faced with a massive job crisis so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent.\n","You would think that any President, whatever his party, would make job creation and nothing else his first order of economic business. But this President didn't do that. Instead, we got a long, divisive, all-or-nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care.\n","Obamacare comes to more than two thousand pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country. That's right. That's right. You know what? The President has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare.\n","And the biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly. You see, even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health care takeover, even with the new law and new taxes on nearly a million small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn't have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more. So they just took it all away from Medicare. Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars funneled out of Medicare by President Obama -- an obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed, all to pay for a new entitlement we didn't even ask for.\n","The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare -- and we're going to stop it. In Congress, when they take out the heavy books and the wall charts about Medicare, my thoughts go back to a house on Garfield Street in Janesville. My wonderful grandma, Janet, had Alzheimer's and she moved in with Mom and me. Though she felt lost at times, we did all the little things that made her feel loved.\n","We had help from Medicare, and it was there, just like it's there for my Mom today. Medicare is a promise and we will honor it. A Romney-Ryan Administration will protect and strengthen Medicare for my Mom's generation, for my generation, and for my kids and yours.\n","So our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the Left isn't going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate.\n","Obamacare, as much as anything else, explains why a presidency that we -- that began with such anticipation now comes to such a disappointing close.\n","It began with a financial crisis; it ends with a job crisis.\n","It began with a housing crisis they alone didn't cause; it ends with a housing crisis they didn't correct.\n","It began with a perfect Triple-A credit rating for the United States; it ends with a downgraded America.\n","It all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new. Now all that's left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed -- like a ship trying to sail on yesterday's wind.\n","You know, President Obama was asked not long ago to reflect on any mistakes he might have made. He said, well, \"I haven't communicated enough.\" He said his job is to (quote) \"tell a story to the American people\" -- as if that's the whole problem here? He needs to talk more and we need to be better listeners?\n","Ladies and gentlemen, these past four years we have suffered no shortage of words in the White House. What is missing is leadership in the White House. (Thank you.) And the story -- And the story that Barack Obama does tell, forever shifting blame to the last Administration, is getting old. The man assumed office almost four years ago. Isn't it about time he assumed responsibility? (Man.)\n","In this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time. Back in 2008, candidate Obama called a 10 trillion dollar national debt \"unpatriotic\" -- serious talk from what looked like a serious reformer.\n","Yet by his own decisions, President Obama has added more debt than any other President before him, and more than all the troubled governments of Europe combined. One President, one term, 5 trillion [dollars in] new debt. He created a bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way, and then did exactly nothing. Republicans -- Republicans stepped up with good-faith reforms and solutions equal to the problems. How did the President respond? By doing nothing -- nothing except to dodge and demagogue the issue.\n","So here we are, 16 trillion dollars in debt -- and still he does nothing. In Europe, massive debts have put entire governments at risk of collapse -- and still he does nothing. And all we have heard from this President and his team are attacks on anyone who dares to point out the obvious. They have no answer to this simple reality: We need to stop spending money we don't have. Really simple. Not that hard.\n","My dad used to say to me: \"Son, you have a choice. You can be part of the problem or you can be part of the solution.\" The present Administration has made its choices. And Mitt Romney and I have made ours: Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation's economic problems. And I'm going to level with you: We don't have that much time. But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.\n","After four years of government trying to divide up the wealth, we will get America creating wealth again. With tax fairness and regulatory reform, we'll put government back on the side of men and women who create jobs, and the men and women who need jobs.\n","My mom started a small business, and I've seen what it takes. Mom was 50 when my dad died. She got on a bus every weekday for years, and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison. She earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. It wasn't just a new livelihood. It was a new life. And it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small businesswoman whose happiness wasn't just in the past. Her work gave her hope. It made our family proud. And to this day, my mom is my role model.\n","Behind every small business, there's a story worth knowing. All the corner shops in our towns and cities, the restaurants, cleaners, gyms, hair salons, hardware stores -- these didn't come out of nowhere. A lot of heart goes into each one. And if small businesspeople say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else worked seven days a week in their place. Nobody showed up in their place to open the door at five in the morning. Nobody did their thinking and worrying and sweating for them. After all that work, and in a bad economy, it sure doesn't help to hear from their President that government gets the credit. What they deserve to hear is the truth: Yes, you did build that!\n","We have a plan for a stronger middle class, with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years.\n","In a clean break -- In a clean break from the Obama years, and frankly from the years before this President, we will keep federal spending at 20 percent of GDP or less, because that is enough. The choice -- The choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government.\n","I learned a good deal about economics, and about America, from the author of the Reagan tax reforms -- the great Jack Kemp. What gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people, in the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair. We need that same optimism right now.\n","And in our dealings with other nations, a Romney-Ryan Administration will speak with confidence and clarity. Whenever men and women rise up for their own freedom, they will know that the American President is on their side. Instead -- Instead of managing American decline, leaving allies to doubt us and adversaries to test us, we will act in the conviction that the United States is still the greatest force for peace and liberty that this world has ever known.\n","President Obama is the kind of politician who puts promises on the record, and then calls that the record. But we are four years into this presidency. The issue is not the economy that Barack Obama inherited, not the economy that he envisions, but this economy that we are living.\n","College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life. (Yes.) Everyone -- Everyone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now. And I hope you understand this too: If you're feeling left out or passed by, you have not failed -- your leaders have failed you.\n","None of us -- None of us should have to settle for the best this Administration offers -- a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us.\n","Listen to the way we're already spoken to -- Listen to the way we're spoken to already, as if everyone is stuck in some class or station in life, victims of circumstances beyond our control, with the government there to help us cope with our fate.\n","It's the exact opposite of everything I learned growing up in Wisconsin, or at college in Ohio. You know, when I was waiting tables, washing dishes, or mowing lawns for money, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life. I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey where I could think for myself, decide for myself, define happiness for myself. That's what we do in this country. That's the American Dream. That's freedom, and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners.\n","By themselves -- By themselves, the failures of one Administration are not a mandate for a new Administration. A challenger must stand on his own merits. He must be ready and worthy to serve in the Office of President.\n","We're a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I. And in some ways we're different. There are the songs on his iPod which I've heard on the campaign bus; and I've heard it [sic] on many hotel elevators. He actually -- He actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies. I said, \"Look, I hope it's not a deal-breaker Mitt, but my playlist, it starts with AC/DC and ends with Zeppelin.\n","A generation apart -- A generation apart, but that doesn't matter.\n","That makes us different, but not in any of the things that matter. Mitt Romney and I both grew up in the heartland, and we know what places like Wisconsin and Michigan look like when times are good. We know what these communities look like when times are good -- when people are working, when families are doing more than just getting by. And we both know it can be that way again.\n","We've had very different careers -- mine mainly in public service, his mostly in the private sector. He helped start businesses and turn around failing ones. And by the way, being successful in business -- that's a good thing.\n","Mitt -- Mitt has not only succeeded, but he succeeded where others could not. He turned around the Olympics at a time when a great institution was collapsing under the weight of bad management, overspending, and corruption. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?\n","He was the Republican governor of a state where almost nine in ten legislators are Democrats, and yet he balanced the budget without raising taxes. Unemployment went down, household incomes went up, and Massachusetts, under governor Mitt Romney, saw its credit rating upgraded.\n","Mitt and I also go to different churches. But in any church, the best kind of preaching is done by example. And I've been watching that example. The man who will accept your nomination tomorrow is prayerful and faithful and honorable. Not only a defender of marriage, he -- he offers an example of marriage at its best. Not only a fine businessman, he's a fine man, worthy of leading this optimistic and good-hearted country.\n","Our faiths come together in the same moral creed. We believe that in every life there is goodness; for every person, there is hope. Each one of us was made for a reason, bearing the image and likeness of the Lord of Life.\n","We have responsibilities, one to another. We do not each face the world alone. And the greatest of all responsibilities, is that of the strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is how it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves.\n","Each of these great moral ideas -- Each of these great moral ideas is essential to democratic government -- to the rule of law, to life in a humane and decent society. They are the moral creed of our country, as powerful in our time, as on the day of America's founding. They are self-evident and unchanging, and sometimes, even Presidents need reminding, that our rights come from nature and God, and not from government.\n","The founding generation secured those rights for us, and in every generation since, the best among us have defended our freedoms. They are protecting us right now. We honor them and all of our veterans -- and we thank them.\n","The right that makes all the difference now is the right to choose our own leaders. And you are entitled to the clearest possible choice, because the time for choosing is drawing near. So here is our pledge.\n","We will not duck the tough issues -- we will lead.\n","We will not spend four years blaming others -- we will take responsibility.\n","We will not try to replace our founding principles -- we will reapply our founding principles.\n","The work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of all of us -- all of us, but we can do this. We can do this. Together, we can do this. We can get this country working again. We can get this economy growing again. We can make the safety net safe again. We can do this.\n","Whatever your political party, let's come together for the sake of our country. Join Mitt Romney and me. Let's give this effort everything we have. Let's see this thing through all the way. Let's get this done.\n","Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," president obama is a newcomer to this campaign. he's the man for the job is governor Mitt Romney - and the president is just throwing away money, iraq says sen. martin mccartney says. \"i'm not going to be able to do anything\" u.s. ambassador to the united states will meet in july on tues --------------------------\n","654 \n","Original text: Ladies and gentlemen:\n","Today I sent my annual message to the Congress, as required by the Constitution. It has been my custom to deliver these annual messages in person, and they have been broadcast to the nation. I intended to follow this same custom this year. But like a great many other people, I've had the flu and, although I am practically recovered, my doctor simply would not let me to leave the White House to go up to the Capitol.\n","Only a few of the newspapers of the United States can print the message in full, and I am anxious that the American people be given an opportunity to hear what I have recommended to the Congress for this very fateful year in our history -- and the reasons for these recommendations. Here is what I said: This nation in the past two years has become an active partner in the world's greatest war against human slavery. We have joined with like-minded people in order to defend ourselves in a world that has been gravely threatened with gangster rule. But I do not think that any of us Americans can be content with mere survival. Sacrifices that we and our Allies are making impose upon all of us a sacred obligation to see to it that out of this war we and our children will gain something better than mere survival. We are united in determination that this war shall not be followed by another interim which leads to new disaster -- that we shall not repeat the tragic errors of ostrich isolationism. When Mr. Hull went to Moscow in October, when I went to Cairo and Teheran in November, we knew that we were in agreement with our Allies in our common determination to fight and win this war. There were many vital questions concerning the future peace, and they were discussed in an atmosphere of complete candor and harmony.\n","In the last war such discussions, such meetings, did not even begin until the shooting had stopped and the delegates began to assemble at the peace table. There had been no previous opportunities for man-to-man discussions which lead to meetings of minds. And the result was a peace which was not a peace. And right here I want to address a word or two to some suspicious souls who are fearful that Mr. Hull or I have made \"commitments\" for the future which might pledge this nation to secret treaties, or to enacting the role of a world Santa Claus. Of course we made commitments. For instance, we most certainly committed ourselves to very large and very specific military plans which require the use of all allied forces to bring about the defeat of our enemies at the earliest possible time. But there were no secret treaties or political or financial commitments.\n","The one supreme objective for the future, which we discussed for each nation individually, and for all the United Nations, can be summed up in one word: security. And that means not only physical security, which provides safety from attacks by aggressors. It means also economic security, social security, moral security -- in a family of nations. In the plain, down-to-earth talks that I had with the Generalissimo and Marshal Stalin and Prime Minister Churchill, it was abundantly clear that they are all most deeply interested in the resumption of peaceful progress by their own peoples -- progress toward a better life. All our Allies have learned by bitter experience that real development will not be possible if they are to be diverted from their purpose by repeated wars -- or even threats of war. The best interests of each nation, large and small, demand that all freedom-loving nations shall join together in a just and durable system of peace. In the present world situation, evidenced by the actions of Germany, and Italy and Japan, unquestioned military control over disturbers of the peace is as necessary among nations as it is among citizens in any community. And an equally basic essential to peace -- permanent peace -- is a decent standard of living for all individual men and women and children in all nations. Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.\n","There are of course people who burrow -- burrow through the nation like unseeing moles, and attempt to spread the suspicion that if other nations are encouraged to raise their standards of living, our own American standard of living must of necessity be depressed. The fact is the very contrary. It has been shown time and again that if the standard of living of any country goes up, so does its purchasing power -- and that such a rise encourages a better standard of living in neighboring countries with whom it trades. That is just plain common sense; and is the kind of plain, common sense that provided the basis for our discussions at Moscow, and Cairo and Teheran.\n","Returning from my journeyings, I must confess to a sense of being \"let down\" when I found many evidences of faulty perspectives here in Washington. The faulty perspective consists in over-emphasizing lesser problems and thereby under-emphasizing the first and greatest problem.\n","The overwhelming majority of our people have met the demands of this war with magnificent courage and a great deal of understanding. They have accepted inconveniences; they have accepted hardships; they have accepted tragic sacrifices.\n","However, while the majority goes on about its great work without complaint, we all know that a noisy minority maintains an uproar, an uproar of demands for special favors for special groups. There are pests who swarm through the lobbies of the Congress and the cocktail bars of Washington, representing these special groups as opposed to the basic interests of the nation as a whole. They have come to look upon the war primarily as a chance to make profits for themselves at the expense of their neighbors -- profits in money or profits in terms of political or social preferment. Such selfish agitation can be and is highly dangerous in wartime. It creates confusion. It damages morale. It hampers our national effort. It prolongs the war.\n","In this war, we have been compelled to learn how interdependent upon each other are all groups and sections of the whole population of America. Increased food costs, for example, will bring new demands for wage increases from all war workers, which will in turn raise all prices of all things including those things which the farmers themselves have to buy. Increased wages or prices will each in turn produce the same results. They are all -- They all have a particularly disastrous result on all fixed income groups.\n","And I hope you will remember that all of us in this Government, including myself, represent the fixed income group just as much as we represent business owners, or workers, or farmers. This group of fixed income people include: teachers, and clergy, and policemen, and firemen, and widows, and minors who are on fixed incomes, wives and dependents of our soldiers and sailors, and old age pensioners. They and their families add up to more than a quarter of our hundred and thirty million people. They have few or no high pressure representatives at the Capitol. And in a period of gross inflation they would be the worst sufferers. Let us give them an occasional thought.\n","If ever there was a time to subordinate individual or group selfishness for the national good, that time is now. Disunity at home, bickering, self-seeking partisanship, stoppages of work, inflation, business as usual, politics as usual, luxury as usual -- and sometimes a failure to tell the whole truth -- these are the influences which can undermine the morale of the brave men ready to die at the front for us here. Those who are doing most of the complaining, I do not think that they are deliberately striving to sabotage the national war effort. They are laboring under the delusion that the time is past when we must make prodigious sacrifices -- that the war is already won and we can begin to slacken off. But the dangerous folly of that point of view can be measured by the distance that separates our troops from their ultimate objectives in Berlin and Tokyo -- and by the sum of all the perils that lie along the way. Over confidence and complacency are among our deadliest of all enemies.\n","That attitude on the part of anyone -- Government or management or labor -- can lengthen this war. It can kill American boys.\n","Let us remember the lessons of 1918. In the summer of that year the tide turned in favor of the Allies. But this Government did not relax, nor did the American people. In fact, our national effort was stepped up. In August 1918, the draft age limits were broadened from 21 to 31 all the way to 18 to 45. The President called for \"force to the utmost,\" and his call was heeded. And in November, only three months later, Germany surrendered. That is the way to fight and win a war -- all out and not with half-an-eye on the battlefronts abroad and the other eye-and-a-half on personal selfish, or political interests here at home.\n","Therefore, in order to concentrate all of our energies, all of our resources on winning this war, and to maintain a fair and stable economy at home, I recommend that the Congress adopt:\n","First, a realistic and simplified tax law -- which will tax all unreasonable profits, both individual and corporate, and reduce the ultimate cost of the war to our sons and our daughters. The tax bill now under consideration by the Congress does not begin to meet this test.\n","Secondly, a continuation of the law for the renegotiation of war contracts -- which will prevent exorbitant profits and assure fair prices to the Government. For two long years I have pleaded with the Congress to take undue profits out of war.\n","Third, a cost of food law -- which will enable the Government to place a reasonable floor under the prices the farmer may expect for his production; and to place a ceiling on the prices a consumer will have to pay for the necessary food he buys. This should apply, as I have intimated, to necessities only; and this will require public funds to carry it out. It will cost in appropriations about one percent of the present annual cost of the war.\n","Fourth, an early re-enactment of the stabilization statute of October, 1942. This expires this year, June 30th, 1944, and if it is not extended well in advance, the country might just as well expect price chaos by summertime. We cannot have stabilization by wishful thinking. We must take positive action to maintain the integrity of the American dollar.\n","And fifth, a national service law -- which, for the duration of the war, will prevent strikes, and, with certain appropriate exceptions, will make available for war production or for any other essential services every able-bodied adult in this whole nation.\n","These five measures together form a just and equitable whole. I would not recommend a national service law unless the other laws were passed to keep down the cost of living, to share equitably the burdens of taxation, to hold the stabilization line, and to prevent undue profits.\n","The Federal Government already has the basic power to draft capital and property of all kinds for war purposes on the basis of \"Just Compensation.\"\n","And, as you know, I have for three years hesitated to recommend a national service act. Today, however, with all the experience we have behind us and with us, I am convinced of its necessity. Although I believe that we and our Allies can win the war without such a measure, I am certain that nothing less than total mobilization of all our resources of manpower and capital will guarantee an earlier victory, and reduce the toll of suffering and sorrow and blood.\n","As some of my advisers wrote me the other day:\n","\"When the very life of the nation is in peril the responsibility for service is common to all men and women. In such a time there can be no discrimination between the men and women who are assigned by the Government to its defense at the battlefront and the men and women assigned to producing the vital materials that are essential to successful military operations. A prompt enactment of a National Service Law would be merely an expression of the universality of this American responsibility.\"\n","I believe the country will agree that those statements are the solemn truth.\n","National service is the most democratic way to wage a war. Like selective service for the Armed Forces, it rests on the obligation of each citizen to serve his nation to -- to his utmost where he is best qualified. It does not mean reduction in wages. It does not mean loss of retirement and seniority rights and benefits. It does not mean that any substantial numbers of war workers will be disturbed in their present jobs. Let this fact be wholly clear.\n","But there are millions of American men and women who are not in this war at all. It is not because they do not want to be in it. But they want to know where they can best do their share. National service provides that direction. I know that all civilian war workers will be glad to be able to say many years hence to their grandchildren: \"Yes, I, too, was in service in the great war. I was on duty in an airplane factory, and I helped to make hundreds of fighting planes. The Government told me that in doing that I was performing my most useful work in the service of my country.\" It is argued that we've passed the stage in the war where national service is necessary. But our soldiers and sailors know that this is not true. We're going forward on a long, rough road -- and, in all journeys, the last miles are the hardest. And it is for that final effort -- for the total defeat of our enemies -- that we must mobilize our total resources. The national war program calls for the employment of more people in 1944 than in 1943. And it is my conviction that the American people will welcome this win-the-war measure which is based on the eternally just principle of fair for one, fair for all. It will give our people at home the assurance that they are standing four-square behind our soldiers and sailors. And it will give our enemies demoralizing assurance that we mean business -- that we, one hundred and thirty million Americans, are on the march to Rome, and Berlin, and Tokyo.\n","I hope that the Congress will recognize that, although this is a political year, national service is an issue which transcends politics. Great power must be used for great purposes. And as to the machinery for this measure, the Congress itself should determine its nature -- as long as it is wholly non-partisan in its make-up. Several alleged reasons have prevented the enactment of legislation which would preserve for our soldiers and sailors and marines the fundamental prerogative of citizenship -- in other words, the right to vote. No amount of legalistic argument can becloud this issue in the eyes of these ten million American citizens. Surely the signers of the Constitution did not intend a document which, even in wartime, would be construed to take away the franchise of any of those who are fighting to preserve the Constitution itself. Our soldiers and sailors and marines know that the overwhelming majority of them will be deprived of the opportunity to vote, if the voting machinery is left exclusively to the States under existing State laws -- and that there is no likelihood of these laws being changed in time to enable them to vote at the next election. The Army and Navy have reported that it will be impossible effectively to administer forty-eight different soldier-voting laws. It is the duty of the Congress to remove this unjustifiable discrimination against the men and women in our Armed Forces -- and to do it just as quickly as possible.\n","It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy. More -- More than the winning of the war, it is time to begin the plans and determine the strategy for winning a lasting peace and the establishment of an American standard of living higher than ever known before. This Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights -- among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and liberty. We have come to a clearer realization of the fact, however, that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. \"Necessitous men are not free men.\" People who are hungry, people who are out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.\n","In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a Second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all -- regardless of station, or race, or creed. Among these are:\n","The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries, or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; The right of farmers to raise and sell their products at a return which will give them and their families a decent living; The right of every business man, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, and sickness, and accident and unemployment; And finally, the right to a good education.\n","All of these rights spell \"security.\" And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being. America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world. One of the great American industrialists of our day -- a man who has rendered yeoman service to his country in this crisis -- recently emphasized the grave dangers of \"rightist reaction\" in this nation. Any clear-thinking business men share that concern. Indeed, if such reaction should develop -- if history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called \"normalcy\" of the 1920's -- then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of fascism here at home.\n","I ask the Congress to explore the means for implementing this economic bill of rights -- for it is definitely the responsibility of the Congress so to do, and the country knows it. Many of these problems are already before committees of the Congress in the form of proposed legislation. I shall from time to time communicate with the Congress with respect to these and further proposals. In the event that no adequate program of progress is evolved, I am certain that the nation will be conscious of the fact.\n","Our fighting men abroad -- and their families at home -- expect such a program and have the right to insist on it. It is to their demands that this Government should pay heed, rather than to the whining demands of selfish pressure groups who seek to feather their nests while young Americans are dying.\n","I have often said that there are no two fronts for America in this war. There is only one front. There is one line of unity that extends from the hearts of people at home to the men of our attacking forces in our farthest outposts. When we speak of our total effort, we speak of the factory and the field and the mine as well as the battlefield. We speak of the soldier and the civilian, the citizen and his Government.\n","Each and every one of us has a solemn obligation under God to serve this nation in its most critical hour, to keep this nation great, to make this nation greater in a better world. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," this year's message was sent to the congress, as required by the constitution. the message has been sent in person, and it has now been broadcast to a nation in the past two years, he says. it was my custom to follow this same custom, but it had been my first time to send it to congress. there were no previous opportunities for man-to-man discussions which led to meetings of minds. --------------------------\n","655 \n","Original text: Mr. President, Friends and Fellow Citizens:\n","He who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than I have. I do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more shrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than I do this day. A feeling has crept over me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. The task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. I know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. I trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. Should I seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me. The little experience I have had in addressing public meetings, in country school houses, avails me nothing on the present occasion.\n","The papers and placards say, that I am to deliver a 4th [of] July oration. This certainly sounds large, and out of the common way, for it is true that I have often had the privilege to speak in this beautiful Hall, and to address many who now honor me with their presence. But neither their familiar faces, nor the perfect gage I think I have of Corinthian Hall, seems to free me from embarrassment.\n","The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, the distance between this platform and the slave plantation, from which I escaped, is considerable - and the difficulties to be overcome in getting from the latter to the former, are by no means slight. That I am here to-day is, to me, a matter of astonishment as well as of gratitude. You will not, therefore, be surprised, if in what I have to say. I evince no elaborate preparation, nor grace my speech with any high sounding exordium. With little experience and with less learning, I have been able to throw my thoughts hastily and imperfectly together; and trusting to your patient and generous indulgence, I will proceed to lay them before you.\n","\"May [the reformer] not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? Were the nation older, the patriot's heart might be sadder, and the reformer's brow heavier. . . . There is consolation in the thought that America is young.\"\n","This, for the purpose of this celebration, is the 4th of July. It is the birthday of your National Independence, and of your political freedom. This, to you, is what the Passover was to the emancipated people of God. It carries your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance; and to the signs, and to the wonders, associated with that act, and that day. This celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the Republic of America is now 76 years old.\n","I am glad, fellow-citizens, that your nation is so young. Seventy-six years, though a good old age for a man, is but a mere speck in the life of a nation. Three score years and ten is the allotted time for individual men; but nations number their years by thousands. According to this fact, you are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. I repeat, I am glad this is so. There is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon.\n","The eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times; but his heart may well beat lighter at the thought that America is young, and that she is still in the impressible stage of her existence. May he not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? Were the nation older, the patriot's heart might be sadder, and the reformer's brow heavier. Its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. There is consolation in the thought that America is young. Great streams are not easily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages. They may sometimes rise in quiet and stately majesty, and inundate the land, refreshing and fertilizing the earth with their mysterious properties. They may also rise in wrath and fury, and bear away, on their angry waves, the accumulated wealth of years of toil and hardship. They, however, gradually flow back to the same old channel, and flow on as serenely as ever. But, while the river may not be turned aside, it may dry up, and leave nothing behind but the withered branch, and the unsightly rock, to howl in the abyss-sweeping wind, the sad tale of departed glory. As with rivers so with nations.\n","Fellow-citizens, I shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. The simple story of it is that, 76 years ago, the people of this country were British subjects. The style and title of your \"sovereign people\" (in which you now glory) was not then born. You were under the British Crown. Your fathers esteemed the English Government as the home government; and England as the fatherland.\n","This home government, you know, although a considerable distance from your home, did, in the exercise of its parental prerogatives, impose upon its colonial children, such restraints, burdens and limitations, as, in its mature judgment, it deemed wise, right and proper.\n","But, your fathers, who had not adopted the fashionable idea of this day, of the infallibility of government, and the absolute character of its acts, presumed to differ from the home government in respect to the wisdom and the justice of some of those burdens and restraints. They went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the measures of government unjust, unreasonable, and oppressive, and altogether such as ought not to be quietly submitted to. I scarcely need say, fellow-citizens, that my opinion of those measures fully accords with that of your fathers.\n","Such a declaration of agreement on my part would not be worth much to anybody. It would, certainly, prove nothing, as to what part I might have taken, had I lived during the great controversy of 1776. To say now that America was right, and England wrong, is exceedingly easy. Everybody can say it; the dastard, not less than the noble brave, can flippantly discant on the tyranny of England towards the American Colonies. It is fashionable to do so; but there was a time when to pronounce against England, and in favor of the cause of the colonies, tried men's souls.\n","They who did so were accounted in their day, of mischief, agitators and rebels, dangerous men. To side with the right, against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day. The cause of liberty may be stabbed by the men who glory in the deeds of your fathers. But, to proceed.\n","Feeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. They petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. Their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. This, however, did not answer the purpose. They saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. Yet they persevered. They were not the men to look back.\n","As the sheet anchor takes a firmer hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger, as it breasted the chilling blasts of kingly displeasure. The greatest and best of British statesmen admitted its justice, and the loftiest eloquence of the British Senate came to its support. But, with that blindness which seems to be the unvarying characteristic of tyrants, since Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the Red Sea, the British Government persisted in the exactions complained of.\n","The madness of this course, we believe, is admitted now, even by England; but we fear the lesson is wholly lost on our present rulers.\n","Oppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. They felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. With brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. Just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! It was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. The timid and the prudent (as has been intimated) of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.\n","Such people lived then, had lived before, and will, probably, ever have a place on this planet; and their course, in respect to any great change, (no matter how great the good to be attained, or the wrong to be redressed by it), may be calculated with as much precision as can be the course of the stars. They hate all changes, but silver, gold and copper change! Of this sort of change they are always strongly in favor.\n","These people were called Tories in the days of your fathers; and the appellation, probably, conveyed the same idea that is meant by a more modern, though a somewhat less euphonious term, which we often find in our papers, applied to some of our old politicians.\n","Their opposition to the then dangerous thought was earnest and powerful; but, amid all their terror and affrighted vociferations against it, the alarming and revolutionary idea moved on, and the country with it.\n","On the 2d of July, 1776, the old Continental Congress, to the dismay of the lovers of ease, and the worshipers of property, clothed that dreadful idea with all the authority of national sanction. They did so in the form of a resolution; and as we seldom hit upon resolutions, drawn up in our day, whose transparency is at all equal to this, it may refresh your minds and help my story if I read it.\n","\"Resolved, That these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be free and Independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, dissolved.\"\n","Citizens, your fathers made good that resolution. They succeeded; and to-day you reap the fruits of their success. The freedom gained is yours; and you, therefore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. The 4th of July is the first great fact in your nation's history - the very ring-bolt in the chain of your yet undeveloped destiny.\n","Pride and patriotism, not less than gratitude, prompt you to celebrate and to hold it in perpetual remembrance. I have said that the Declaration of Independence is the ring-bolt to the chain of your nation's destiny; so, indeed, I regard it. The principles contained in that instrument are saving principles. Stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.\n","From the round top of your ship of state, dark and threatening clouds may be seen. Heavy billows, like mountains in the distance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! That bolt drawn, that chain broken, and all is lost. Cling to this day - cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.\n","The coming into being of a nation, in any circumstances, is an interesting event. But, besides general considerations, there were peculiar circumstances which make the advent of this republic an event of special attractiveness.\n","The whole scene, as I look back to it, was simple, dignified and sublime.\n","The population of the country, at the time, stood at the insignificant number of three millions. The country was poor in the munitions of war. The population was weak and scattered, and the country a wilderness unsubdued. There were then no means of concert and combination, such as exist now. Neither steam nor lightning had then been reduced to order and discipline. From the Potomac to the Delaware was a journey of many days. Under these, and innumerable other disadvantages, your fathers declared for liberty and independence and triumphed.\n","Fellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men too - great enough to give fame to a great age. It does not often happen to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. The point from which I am compelled to view them is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. They were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory.\n","They loved their country better than their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare virtue, and that when it is exhibited, it ought to command respect. He who will, intelligently, lay down his life for his country, is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise. Your fathers staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, on the cause of their country. In their admiration of liberty, they lost sight of all other interests.\n","They were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. They were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression. They showed forbearance; but that they knew its limits. They believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny. With them, nothing was \"settled\" that was not right. With them, justice, liberty and humanity were \"final;\" not slavery and oppression. You may well cherish the memory of such men. They were great in their day and generation. Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.\n","How circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! How unlike the politicians of an hour! Their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. They seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defense. Mark them!\n","Fully appreciating the hardship to be encountered, firmly believing in the right of their cause, honorably inviting the scrutiny of an on-looking world, reverently appealing to heaven to attest their sincerity, soundly comprehending the solemn responsibility they were about to assume, wisely measuring the terrible odds against them, your fathers, the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep the corner-stone of the national superstructure, which has risen and still rises in grandeur around you.\n","Of this fundamental work, this day is the anniversary. Our eyes are met with demonstrations of joyous enthusiasm. Banners and pennants wave exultingly on the breeze. The din of business, too, is hushed. Even Mammon seems to have quitted his grasp on this day. The ear-piercing fife and the stirring drum unite their accents with the ascending peal of a thousand church bells. Prayers are made, hymns are sung, and sermons are preached in honor of this day; while the quick martial tramp of a great and multitudinous nation, echoed back by all the hills, valleys and mountains of a vast continent, bespeak the occasion one of thrilling and universal interests nation's jubilee.\n","Friends and citizens, I need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. Many of you understand them better than I do. You could instruct me in regard to them. That is a branch of knowledge in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker. The causes which led to the separation of the colonies from the British crown have never lacked for a tongue. They have all been taught in your common schools, narrated at your firesides, unfolded from your pulpits, and thundered from your legislative halls, and are as familiar to you as household words. They form the staple of your national poetry and eloquence.\n","I remember, also, that, as a people, Americans are remarkably familiar with all facts which make in their own favor. This is esteemed by some as a national trait - perhaps a national weakness. It is a fact, that whatever makes for the wealth or for the reputation of Americans, and can be had cheap! will be found by Americans. I shall not be charged with slandering Americans, if I say I think the American side of any question may be safely left in American hands.\n","I leave, therefore, the great deeds of your fathers to other gentlemen whose claim to have been regularly descended will be less likely to be disputed than mine!\n","My business, if I have any here to-day, is with the present. The accepted time with God and his cause is the ever-living now.\n","Trust no future, however pleasant, Let the dead past bury its dead; Act, act in the living present, Heart within, and God overhead.\n","We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. To all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. But now is the time, the important time. Your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. You live and must die, and you must do your work. You have no right to enjoy a child's share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors. You have no right to wear out and waste the hard-earned fame of your fathers to cover your indolence. Sydney Smith tells us that men seldom eulogize the wisdom and virtues of their fathers, but to excuse some folly or wickedness of their own. This truth is not a doubtful one.\n","There are illustrations of it near and remote, ancient and modern. It was fashionable, hundreds of years ago, for the children of Jacob to boast, we have \"Abraham to our father,\" when they had long lost Abraham's faith and spirit. That people contented themselves under the shadow of Abraham's great name, while they repudiated the deeds which made his name great. Need I remind you that a similar thing is being done all over this country to-day? Need I tell you that the Jews are not the only people who built the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepulchres of the righteous? Washington could not die fill he had broken the chains of his slaves. Yet his monument is built up by the price of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men, shout - \"We have Washington to our father.\" Alas! that it should be so; yet so it is.\n","The evil that men do, lives after them, The good is oft' interred with their bones.\n","What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence?\n","Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?\n","Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold, that a nation's sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation's jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been tom from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the \"lame man leap as an hart.\"\n","But, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine.\n","You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, lowering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!\n","\"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.\"\n","Fellow-citizens; above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, \"may my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\" To forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the world.\n","My subject, then fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see, this day, and its popular characteristics, from the slave's point of view. Standing, there, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July!\n","Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery-the great sin and shame of America!\n","\"I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;\" I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be fight and just.\n","But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuade more, and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed.\n","But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it.\n","The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia, which, if committed by a black man, (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment.\n","What is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual and responsible being? The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write.\n","When you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field, then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, their will I argue with you that the slave is a man!\n","For the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the negro race. Is it not astonishing that, while we are ploughing, planting and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California, capturing the whale in the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the Christian's God, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!\n","Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? That he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for Republicans? Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood? How should I look to-day, in the presence of Americans, dividing, and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? speaking of it relatively, and positively, negatively, and affirmatively. To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and lo offer an insult to your understanding. There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.\n","What, am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to bum their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? No! I will not. I have better employments for my time and strength, than such arguments would imply.\n","What, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman, cannot be divine! Who can reason on such a proposition? They that can, may; I cannot. The time for such argument is past.\n","At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation's ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.\n","What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelly to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy - a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\n","There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour. Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.\n","Take the American slave-trade, which, we are told by the papers, is especially prosperous just now. Ex-Senator Benton tells us that the price of men was never higher than now. He mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. This trade is one of the peculiarities of American institutions. It is carried on in all the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every year, by dealers in this horrid traffic.\n","In several states, this trade is a chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to the foreign slave-trade) \"the internal slave trade.\" It is, probably, called so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave-trade is contemplated. That trade has long since been denounced by this government, as piracy. It has been denounced with burning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable traffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere, in this country, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave-trade, as a most inhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of God and of man.\n","The duty to extirpate and destroy it, is admitted even by our DOCTORS OF DIVINITY. In order to put an end to it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren (nominally free) should leave this country, and establish themselves on the western coast of Africa! It is, however, a notable fact that, while so much execration is poured out by Americans upon those engaged in the foreign slave-trade, the men engaged in the slave-trade between the states pass without condemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.\n","Behold the practical operation of this internal slave-trade, the American slave-trade, sustained by American politics and American religion. Here you will see men and women reared like swine for the market. You know what is a swine-drover? I will show you a man-drover. They inhabit all our Southern States.\n","They perambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation, with droves of human stock. You will see one of these human flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children, from the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched people are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They are food for the cotton-field, and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad procession, as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them.\n","Hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives! There, see the old man, with locks thinned and gray. Cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping, yes! weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn!\n","The drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their strength; suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted with a scream, that seems to have torn its way to the centre of your soul! The crack you heard, was the sound of the slave-whip; the scream you heard, was from the woman you saw with the babe. Her speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains! that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. Follow this drove to New Orleans. Attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of American slave-buyers. See this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. Tell me citizens, WHERE, under the sun, you can witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking. Yet this is but a glance at the American slave-trade, as it exists, at this moment, in the ruling part of the United States.\n","I was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave-trade is a terrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of its horrors. I lived on Philpot Street, Fell's Point, Baltimore, and have watched from the wharves, the slave ships in the Basin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down the Chesapeake.\n","There was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of Pratt Street, by Austin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town and county in Maryland, announcing their arrival, through the papers, and on flaming \"hand-bills,\" headed CASH FOR NEGROES. These men were generally well dressed men, and very captivating in their manners. Ever ready to drink, to treat, and to gamble. The fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mother by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.\n","The flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, to the general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number have been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew to Mobile, or to New Orleans. From the slave prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of night; for since the antislavery agitation, a certain caution is observed.\n","In the deep still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by the dead heavy footsteps, and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door. The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I was often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. I was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.\n","Fellow-citizens, this murderous traffic is, to-day, in active operation in this boasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit, I see clouds of dust raised on the highways of the South; I see the bleeding footsteps; I hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave-markets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. There I see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice and rapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight.\n","Is this the land your Fathers loved, The freedom which they toiled to win? Is this the earth whereon they moved? Are these the graves they slumber in?\n","But a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains to be presented.\n","By an act of the American Congress, not yet two years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. By that act, Mason & Dixon's line has been obliterated; New York has become as Virginia; and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole United States.\n","The power is co-extensive with the star-spangled banner and American Christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter. Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the sportsman's gun. By that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person of every man are put in peril. Your broad republican domain is hunting ground for men. Not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime. Your lawmakers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this hellish sport.\n","Your President, your Secretary of State, your lords, nobles, and ecciesiastics, enforce, as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country, and to your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not fewer than forty Americans have, within the past two years, been hunted down and, without a moment's warning, hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Some of these have had wives and children, dependent on them for bread; but of this, no account was made.\n","The right of the hunter to his prey stands superior to the right of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of God included! For black men there are neither law, justice, humanity, not religion. The Fugitive Slave Law makes MERCY TO THEM, A CRIME; and bribes the judge who tries them. An American JUDGE GETS TEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY VICTIM HE CONSIGNS to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so.\n","The oath of any two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony is nothing. He can bring no witnesses for himself. The minister of American justice is bound by the law to hear but one side; and that side, is the side of the oppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told.\n","Let it be thundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king-hating, people-loving, democratic, Christian America, the seats of justice are filled with judges, who hold their offices under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man's liberty, hear only his accusers!\n","In glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of administering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenceless, and in diabolical intent, this Fugitive Slave Law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on the globe, having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. If any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, I will gladly confront him at any suitable time and place he may select.\n","I take this law to be one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty, and, if the churches and ministers of our country were not stupidly blind, or most wickedly indifferent, they, too, would so regard it.\n","At the very moment that they are thanking God for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, and for the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, they are utterly silent in respect to a law which robs religion of its chief significance, and makes it utterly worthless to a world lying in wickedness.\n","Did this law concern the \"mint, anise and cummin\" - abridge the fight to sing psalms, to partake of the sacrament, or to engage in any of the ceremonies of religion, it would be smitten by the thunder of a thousand pulpits. A general shout would go up from the church, demanding repeal, repeal, instant repeal! And it would go hard with that politician who presumed to solicit the votes of the people without inscribing this motto on his banner.\n","Further, if this demand were not complied with, another Scotland would be added to the history of religious liberty, and the stern old Covenanters would be thrown into the shade. A John Knox would be seen at every church door, and heard from every pulpit, and Fillmore would have no more quarter than was shown by Knox, to the beautiful, but treacherous queen Mary of Scotland. The fact that the church of our country, (with fractional exceptions), does not esteem \"the Fugitive Slave Law\" as a declaration of war against religious liberty, implies that that church regards religion simply as a form of worship, an empty ceremony, and not a vital principle, requiring active benevolence, justice, love and good will towards man. It esteems sacrifice above mercy; psalm-singing above right doing; solemn meetings above practical righteousness.\n","A worship that can be conducted by persons who refuse to give shelter to the houseless, to give bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and who enjoin obedience to a law forbidding these acts of mercy, is a curse, not a blessing to mankind. The Bible addresses all such persons as \"scribes, pharisees, hypocrites, who pay tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith.\"\n","But the church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of die slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. It has made itself the bulwark of American slavery, and the shield of American slave-hunters. Many of its most eloquent Divines. who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the Bible to the whole slave system.\n","They have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of God; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for Christianity.\n","For my part, I would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those Divines! They convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny, and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Bolingbroke, put together, have done! These ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action, nor bowels of compassion.\n","They strip the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. It is not that \"pure and undefiled religion\" which is from above, and which is \"first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\" But a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes God a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man.\n","All this we affirm to be true of the popular church, and the popular worship of our land and nation - a religion, a church, and a worship which, on the authority of inspired wisdom, we pronounce to be an abomination in the sight of God. In the language of Isaiah, the American church might be well addressed, \"Bring no more vain ablations; incense is an abomination unto me: the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.\n","Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. They are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you. Yea! when ye make many prayers, I will not hear. YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF BLOOD; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge for the fatherless; plead for the widow.\"\n","The American church is guilty, when viewed in connection with what it is doing to uphold slavery; but it is superlatively guilty when viewed in connection with its ability to abolish slavery. The sin of which it is guilty is one of omission as well as of commission. Albert Barnes but uttered what the common sense of every man at all observant of the actual state of the case will receive as truth, when he declared that \"There is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.\"\n","Let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds; and that they do not do this involves them in the most awful responsibility of which the mind can conceive.\n","In prosecuting the anti-slavery enterprise, we have been asked to spare the church, to spare the ministry; but how, we ask, could such a thing be done? We are met on the threshold of our efforts for the redemption of the slave, by the church and ministry of the country, in battle arrayed against us; and we are compelled to fight or flee.\n","From what quarter, I beg to know, has proceeded a fire so deadly upon our ranks, during the last two years, as from the Northern pulpit? As the champions of oppressors, the chosen men of American theology have appeared-men, honored for their so-called piety, and their real learning.\n","The LORDS of Buffalo, the SPRINGS of New York, the LATHROPS of Auburn, the COXES and SPENCERS of Brooklyn, the GANNETS and SHARPS of Boston, the DEWEYS of Washington, and other great religious lights of the land, have, in utter denial of the authority of Him, by whom they professed to he called to the ministry, deliberately taught us, against the example or the Hebrews and against the remonstrance of the Apostles, they teach \"that we ought to obey man's law before the law of God.\"\n","My spirit wearies of such blasphemy; and how such men can be supported, as the \"standing types and representatives of Jesus Christ,\" is a mystery which I leave others to penetrate. In speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land.\n","There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States, of whom Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn, Samuel J. May of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend* on the platform, are shining examples; and let me say further, that upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains. [*Rev. R. R. Raymond]\n","One is struck with the difference between the attitude of the American church towards the anti-slavery movement, and that occupied by the churches in England towards a similar movement in that country. There, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, elevating, and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly, bound up the wounds of the West Indian slave, and restored him to his liberty.\n","There, the question of emancipation was a high[ly] religious question. It was demanded, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living God. The Sharps, the Clarksons, the Wilberforces, the Buxtons, and Burchells and the Knibbs, were alike famous for their piety, and for their philanthropy.\n","The anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement, for the reason that the church took its full share in prosecuting that movement: and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement, when the church of this country shall assume a favorable, instead or a hostile position towards that movement. Americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent.\n","You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity, while the whole political power of the nation (as embodied in the two great political parties), is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. You hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of Russia and Austria, and pride yourselves on your Democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and bodyguards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina.\n","You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot and kill. You glory in your refinement and your universal education; yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation - a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty.\n","You shed tears over fallen Hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse!\n","You are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America. You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. You can bare your bosom to the storm of British artillery to throw off a three-penny tax on tea; and yetwring the last hard-earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country.\n","You profess to believe \"that, of one blood, God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,\" and hath commanded all men, everywhere to love one another; yet you notoriously hate, (and glory in your hatred), all men whose skins are not colored like your own.\n","You declare, before the world, and are understood by the world to declare, that you \"hotel these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; and that, among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;\" and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own Thomas Jefferson, \"is worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,\" a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.\n","Fellow-citizens! I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretence, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a by word to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union.\n","It fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it, as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. Oh! be warned! be warned! a horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation's bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of God, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!\n","But it is answered in reply to all this, that precisely what I have now denounced is, in fact, guaranteed and sanctioned by the Constitution of the United States; that the right to hold and to hunt slaves is a part of that Constitution framed by the illustrious Fathers of this Republic.\n","Then, I dare to affirm, notwithstanding all I have said before, your fathers stooped, basely stooped\n","To palter with us in a double sense: And keep the word of promise to the ear, But break it to the heart.\n","And instead of being the honest men I have before declared them to be, they were the veriest imposters that ever practiced on mankind. This is the inevitable conclusion, and from it there is no escape. But I differ from those who charge this baseness on the framers of the Constitution of the United States. It is a slander upon their memory, at least, so I believe.\n","There is not time now to argue the constitutional question at length - nor have I the ability to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. The subject has been handled with masterly power by Lysander Spooner, Esq., by William Goodell, by Samuel E. Sewall, Esq., and last, though not least, by Gerritt Smith, Esq. These gentlemen have, as I think, fully and clearly vindicated the Constitution from any design to support slavery for an hour.\n","\"[L]et me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the Constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it.\"\n","Fellow-citizens! there is no matter in respect to which, the people of the North have allowed themselves to be so ruinously imposed upon, as that of the pro-slavery character of the Constitution. In that instrument I hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but, interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT.\n","Read its preamble, consider its purposes. Is slavery among them? Is it at the gateway? or is it in the temple? It is neither. While I do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the Constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slave-holding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can anywhere be found in it.\n","What would be thought of an instrument, drawn up, legally drawn up, for the purpose of entitling the city of Rochester to a track of land, in which no mention of land was made? Now, there are certain rules of interpretation, for the proper understanding of all legal instruments. These rules are well established. They are plain, common-sense rules, such as you and I, and all of us, can understand and apply, without having passed years in the study of law.\n","I scout the idea that the question of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of slavery is not a question for the people. I hold that every American citizen has a fight to form an opinion of the constitution, and to propagate that opinion, and to use all honorable means to make his opinion the prevailing one. Without this fight, the liberty of an American citizen would be as insecure as that of a Frenchman.\n","Ex-Vice-President Dallas tells us that the constitution is an object to which no American mind can be too attentive, and no American heart too devoted. He further says, the constitution, in its words, is plain and intelligible, and is meant for the home-bred, unsophisticated understandings of our fellow-citizens. Senator Berrien tell us that the Constitution is the fundamental law, that which controls all others.\n","The charter of our liberties, which every citizen has a personal interest in understanding thoroughly. The testimony of Senator Breese, Lewis Cass, and many others that might be named, who are everywhere esteemed as sound lawyers, so regard the constitution. I take it, therefore, that it is not presumption in a private citizen to form an opinion of that instrument.\n","Now, take the constitution according to its plain reading, and I defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it. On the other hand it will be found to contain principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.\n","I have detained my audience entirely too long already. At some future period I will gladly avail myself of an opportunity to give this subject a full and fair discussion.\n","\"Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country.\"\n","Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work The downfall of slavery. \"The arm of the Lord is not shortened,\" and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age.\n","Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world, and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. Walled cities and empires have become unfashionable.\n","The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest comers of the globe. It makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. From Boston to London is now a holiday excursion. Space is comparatively annihilated. Thoughts expressed on one side of the Atlantic are, distinctly heard on the other. The far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. The Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat of the Almighty, \"Let there be Light,\" has not yet spent its force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light.\n","The iron shoe, and crippled foot of China must be seen, in contrast with nature. Africa must rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. \"Ethiopia shall stretch out her hand unto God.\" In the fervent aspirations of William Lloyd Garrison, I say, and let every heart join in saying it:\n","God speed the year of jubilee\n","The wide world o'er! When from their galling chains set free, Th' oppress'd shall vilely bend the knee, And wear the yoke of tyranny Like brutes no more. That year will come, and freedom's reign, To man his plundered fights again Restore.\n","God speed the day when human blood Shall cease to flow! In every clime be understood, The claims of human brotherhood, And each return for evil, good, Not blow for blow; That day will come all feuds to end And change into a faithful friend Each foe.\n","God speed the hour, the glorious hour, When none on earth Shall exercise a lordly power, Nor in a tyrant's presence cower; But all to manhood's stature tower, By equal birth! THAT HOUR WILL, COME, to each, to all, And from his prison-house, the thrall Go forth.\n","Until that year, day, hour, arrive, With head, and heart, and hand I'll strive, To break the rod, and rend the gyve, The spoiler of his prey deprive- So witness Heaven!

He was finally free, but there was no joy in his heart. He thought there never would be again. Liberated a day earlier by American soldiers, he remembers their rage at what they saw. And even if he lives to be a very old man, he will always be grateful to them for that rage, and also for their compassion. Though he did not understand their language, their eyes told him what he needed to know -- that they, too, would remember, and bear witness.\n","And now, I stand before you, Mr. President -- Commander-in-Chief of the army that freed me, and tens of thousands of others -- and I am filled with a profound and abiding gratitude to the American people. \"Gratitude\" is a word that I cherish. Gratitude is what defines the humanity of the human being. And I am grateful to you, Hillary, or Mrs. Clinton, for what you said, and for what you are doing for children in the world, for the homeless, for the victims of injustice, the victims of destiny and society. And I thank all of you for being here.\n","We are on the threshold of a new century, a new millennium. What will the legacy of this vanishing century be? How will it be remembered in the new millennium? Surely it will be judged, and judged severely, in both moral and metaphysical terms. These failures have cast a dark shadow over humanity: two World Wars, countless civil wars, the senseless chain of assassinations (Gandhi, the Kennedys, Martin Luther King, Sadat, Rabin), bloodbaths in Cambodia and Algeria, India and Pakistan, Ireland and Rwanda, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Sarajevo and Kosovo; the inhumanity in the gulag and the tragedy of Hiroshima. And, on a different level, of course, Auschwitz and Treblinka. So much violence; so much indifference.\n","What is indifference? Etymologically, the word means \"no difference.\" A strange and unnatural state in which the lines blur between light and darkness, dusk and dawn, crime and punishment, cruelty and compassion, good and evil. What are its courses and inescapable consequences? Is it a philosophy? Is there a philosophy of indifference conceivable? Can one possibly view indifference as a virtue? Is it necessary at times to practice it simply to keep one's sanity, live normally, enjoy a fine meal and a glass of wine, as the world around us experiences harrowing upheavals?\n","Of course, indifference can be tempting -- more than that, seductive. It is so much easier to look away from victims. It is so much easier to avoid such rude interruptions to our work, our dreams, our hopes. It is, after all, awkward, troublesome, to be involved in another person's pain and despair. Yet, for the person who is indifferent, his or her neighbor are of no consequence. And, therefore, their lives are meaningless. Their hidden or even visible anguish is of no interest. Indifference reduces the Other to an abstraction.\n","Over there, behind the black gates of Auschwitz, the most tragic of all prisoners were the \"Muselmanner,\" as they were called. Wrapped in their torn blankets, they would sit or lie on the ground, staring vacantly into space, unaware of who or where they were -- strangers to their surroundings. They no longer felt pain, hunger, thirst. They feared nothing. They felt nothing. They were dead and did not know it.\n","Rooted in our tradition, some of us felt that to be abandoned by humanity then was not the ultimate. We felt that to be abandoned by God was worse than to be punished by Him. Better an unjust God than an indifferent one. For us to be ignored by God was a harsher punishment than to be a victim of His anger. Man can live far from God -- not outside God. God is wherever we are. Even in suffering? Even in suffering.\n","In a way, to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the human being inhuman. Indifference, after all, is more dangerous than anger and hatred. Anger can at times be creative. One writes a great poem, a great symphony. One does something special for the sake of humanity because one is angry at the injustice that one witnesses. But indifference is never creative. Even hatred at times may elicit a response. You fight it. You denounce it. You disarm it.\n","Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning; it is an end. And, therefore, indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten. The political prisoner in his cell, the hungry children, the homeless refugees -- not to respond to their plight, not to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile them from human memory. And in denying their humanity, we betray our own.\n","Indifference, then, is not only a sin, it is a punishment.\n","And this is one of the most important lessons of this outgoing century's wide-ranging experiments in good and evil.\n","In the place that I come from, society was composed of three simple categories: the killers, the victims, and the bystanders. During the darkest of times, inside the ghettoes and death camps -- and I'm glad that Mrs. Clinton mentioned that we are now commemorating that event, that period, that we are now in the Days of Remembrance -- but then, we felt abandoned, forgotten. All of us did.\n","And our only miserable consolation was that we believed that Auschwitz and Treblinka were closely guarded secrets; that the leaders of the free world did not know what was going on behind those black gates and barbed wire; that they had no knowledge of the war against the Jews that Hitler's armies and their accomplices waged as part of the war against the Allies. If they knew, we thought, surely those leaders would have moved heaven and earth to intervene. They would have spoken out with great outrage and conviction. They would have bombed the railways leading to Birkenau, just the railways, just once.\n","And now we knew, we learned, we discovered that the Pentagon knew, the State Department knew. And the illustrious occupant of the White House then, who was a great leader -- and I say it with some anguish and pain, because, today is exactly 54 years marking his death -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt died on April the 12th, 1945. So he is very much present to me and to us. No doubt, he was a great leader. He mobilized the American people and the world, going into battle, bringing hundreds and thousands of valiant and brave soldiers in America to fight fascism, to fight dictatorship, to fight Hitler. And so many of the young people fell in battle. And, nevertheless, his image in Jewish history -- I must say it -- his image in Jewish history is flawed.\n","The depressing tale of the St. Louis is a case in point. Sixty years ago, its human cargo -- nearly 1,000 Jews -- was turned back to Nazi Germany. And that happened after the Kristallnacht, after the first state sponsored pogrom, with hundreds of Jewish shops destroyed, synagogues burned, thousands of people put in concentration camps. And that ship, which was already in the shores of the United States, was sent back. I don't understand. Roosevelt was a good man, with a heart. He understood those who needed help.\n","Why didn't he allow these refugees to disembark? A thousand people -- in America, the great country, the greatest democracy, the most generous of all new nations in modern history. What happened? I don't understand. Why the indifference, on the highest level, to the suffering of the victims?\n","But then, there were human beings who were sensitive to our tragedy. Those non-Jews, those Christians, that we call the \"Righteous Gentiles,\" whose selfless acts of heroism saved the honor of their faith. Why were they so few? Why was there a greater effort to save SS murderers after the war than to save their victims during the war? Why did some of America's largest corporations continue to do business with Hitler's Germany until 1942? It has been suggested, and it was documented, that the Wehrmacht could not have conducted its invasion of France without oil obtained from American sources. How is one to explain their indifference?\n","And yet, my friends, good things have also happened in this traumatic century: the defeat of Nazism, the collapse of communism, the rebirth of Israel on its ancestral soil, the demise of apartheid, Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, the peace accord in Ireland. And let us remember the meeting, filled with drama and emotion, between Rabin and Arafat that you, Mr. President, convened in this very place. I was here and I will never forget it.\n","And then, of course, the joint decision of the United States and NATO to intervene in Kosovo and save those victims, those refugees, those who were uprooted by a man, whom I believe that because of his crimes, should be charged with crimes against humanity.\n","But this time, the world was not silent. This time, we do respond. This time, we intervene.\n","Does it mean that we have learned from the past? Does it mean that society has changed? Has the human being become less indifferent and more human? Have we really learned from our experiences? Are we less insensitive to the plight of victims of ethnic cleansing and other forms of injustices in places near and far? Is today's justified intervention in Kosovo, led by you, Mr. President, a lasting warning that never again will the deportation, the terrorization of children and their parents, be allowed anywhere in the world? Will it discourage other dictators in other lands to do the same?\n","What about the children? Oh, we see them on television, we read about them in the papers, and we do so with a broken heart. Their fate is always the most tragic, inevitably. When adults wage war, children perish. We see their faces, their eyes. Do we hear their pleas? Do we feel their pain, their agony? Every minute one of them dies of disease, violence, famine.\n","Some of them -- so many of them -- could be saved.\n","And so, once again, I think of the young Jewish boy from the Carpathian Mountains. He has accompanied the old man I have become throughout these years of quest and struggle. And together we walk towards the new millennium, carried by profound fear and extraordinary hope. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," \"Gratitude\" is a word that I cherish, and I am grateful to you, Hillary, or Mrs. Clinton, for what you said. john sutter: we are on the threshold of the new millennium, but it will be judged severely, in both moral and metaphysical terms. --------------------------\n","657 \n","Original text: Good morning. I am honored to bring greetings from President Obama. (I think I should sit down now.) I'm -- I'm also honored to bring greetings from my fellow members of his Cabinet, and from my colleagues in the Department of Justice. I'm also grateful for the opportunity to join so many extraordinary leaders and friends in celebrating the life and work of Ebenezer’s former pastor -- and our nation’s greatest “drum major for peace” -- the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n","But -- But today, I...also want to note that we also celebrate the contributions of his wonderful wife -- a woman -- a woman who often noted that she married, not only a man but also a movement, and who was a force for change in her own right -- Coretta Scott King.\n","Throughout -- Throughout his life and -- most famously -- on the eve of his death, as he delivered the legendary “Mountaintop” speech that would be his final sermon, Reverend King asked himself when -- if given the choice of any era in history -- he would choose to be alive.\n","This question began with a journey through the ages. At each stop -- whether Mount Olympus or ancient Rome, Lincoln’s signing of the Emancipation Proclamation or Roosevelt’s call to fear only fear itself -- Dr. King asked himself what era he would choose to be part of. His own, he decided, explaining that happiness comes from embracing the blessings and burdens of fate and the opportunities that accompany living in times of unprecedented challenge. “I know,” he said, “that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.”\n","Today, once again, it is dark enough.\n","Last week, a senseless rampage in Tucson, Arizona, reminded us that, more than 40 years after Dr. King’s own tragic death, our long struggle to end suffering and to eradicate violence goes on. But, today, once more, we can see the stars.\n","We see them in the courage of a husband who died shielding his wife from a spray of bullets; in the kindness of strangers who raced to the aid of those in need; and in the strength of a young, energetic Congresswoman whose fight for her own life has inspired each of ours.\n","As we continue to mourn those recently lost, and to pray for those now in need of healing and comfort, let us also recommit ourselves to carrying on Dr. King’s work and to honoring the values that were at the center of his life: tolerance; non-violence; compassion; love; and -- above all -- justice.\n","I wish that Dr. King could be here with us to see the America that he helped to create. I wish that Dr. King could see the good will and great works that he still inspires. I wish that Dr. King could see that this place of worship continues to be a place of learning, of healing, and of hope; and that the nation he fought to improve soon will honor his memory by consecrating a memorial in Washington, D.C., on our national mall -- within sight of monuments to our nation’s first President and its Great Emancipator.\n","Today, we must look upon our country as Dr. King did. Half a century ago, he saw -- not only great challenges, but also extraordinary opportunities. And he saw -- clearly -- that for every individual to be free, our entire society had to be transformed.\n","Despite the odds against him, he was undeterred. Despite the obstacles before him, he kept his faith. And despite those who tried to stand in his way, in and out of governments, he proved that -- here in America -- large-scale, sweeping, righteous change is not impossible. It is not too audacious. It is not too ambitious. And it is not the province of God and prayer alone.\n","Each of us has the power to improve the world around us. Each of us also has the responsibility, the duty, to do so. Each of us must act.\n","Dr. King’s example provides proof that, in the work of promoting peace and ensuring justice, one person can make a difference. Individual actions count. And those who are willing to march toward progress, to stand up for a principle, or, simply, to take a seat -- in a courthouse or a classroom, at a lunch counter or the front of a bus -- can help to change the world.\n","Of course, this is not easy work. And it may be inspired by frustration just as often as faith. But one of the most important lessons that Dr. King left to us is that it is fine to be frustrated, to be impatient, and to be dissatisfied -- if it compels us to take action.\n","Dr. King was dissatisfied when anyone -- anywhere -- faced discrimination and oppression. He was dissatisfied when people of color were denied access to public spaces, to educational opportunities, and to good jobs.\n","He was dissatisfied when citizens who loved their country -- including those who honorably served in uniform -- were not allowed to vote or were forcibly discouraged from taking part in elections. And he was dissatisfied when -- in pursuit of his dream of a just and inclusive America -- he was told to “wait,” to “cool off,” or to “back down.”\n","What if he had listened? What if he had given into doubt and cynicism? What if he had given up? What if he had been patient? Just think about where we would be. Our nation would not have accomplished the progress that has brought America closer to its founding principles -- and made our country more true to our founding documents. For myself, I can’t imagine that I would be standing before you today -- on this celebration of Dr. King’s 82nd birthday -- as our nation’s 82nd Attorney General.\n","When I consider the opportunities that I have had, and that my parents did not, I feel blessed beyond measure. And I feel proud of our nation. But -- like Dr. King -- I am also dissatisfied.\n","I am dissatisfied that -- here in Atlanta -- there are neighborhoods where young people are more likely to go to prison than to college; and that, in America today, more than one million young people are active gang members.\n","I am dissatisfied that more than 1.5 million American children have a parent behind bars; and that the majority of our nation’s kids -- more than 60 percent of them -- have been exposed to crime, abuse, and violence.\n","I am dissatisfied that, even though crime rates have been on a steady decline for the last decade, gun-related deaths have increased each year since 2002. And I am dissatisfied that, over the last 12 months, the number of police officers killed by gun violence has surged by more than 40 percent.\n","So, yes, like Dr. King -- and like many of you -- I am dissatisfied. But I am also hopeful. I believe that we, as a people, have the ability to focus on matters that are truly consequential -- and to move beyond trivial issues that only serve to divide us. And I am certain that America’s continued progress will depend on our ability to come together -- with open hearts and outstretched hands -- and to keep faith in the ideals that guided Dr. King’s work and that have made our nation great.\n","This capacity is within us. Dr. King recognized this. And our history has shown us that, in times of maximum peril, the American people find ways to come together. It is time. We must do so again.\n","May God continue to bless our efforts. May God continue to bless the memory of one of his great servants. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," a senseless rampage in Tucson, Arizona, reminded us that more than 40 years after Dr. King's death, our long struggle to end suffering and eradicate violence goes on. we see the stars in the courage of the husband who died shielding his wife from bullets; in kindness of strangers who raced to the aid of those in need; and in strength of an energetic congresswoman whose fight for her own life has inspired each of ours. --------------------------\n","658 \n","Original text: Today, I want to share candid thoughts about an issue which for decades has animated the foreign policy dialogue here and around the world -- the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n","Throughout his Administration, President Obama has been deeply committed to Israel and its security, and that commitment has guided his pursuit of peace in the Middle East. This is an issue which, all of you know, I have worked on intensively during my time as Secretary of State for one simple reason: because the two-state solution is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. It is the only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors. It is the only way to ensure a future of freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people. And it is an important way of advancing United States interests in the region.\n","Now, I’d like to explain why that future is now in jeopardy, and provide some context for why we could not, in good conscience, stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\n","I’m also here to share my conviction that there is still a way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act. And I want to share practical suggestions for how to preserve and advance the prospects for the just and lasting peace that both sides deserve.\n","So it is vital that we have an honest, clear-eyed conversation about the uncomfortable truths and difficult choices, because the alternative that is fast becoming the reality on the ground is in nobody’s interest -- not the Israelis, not the Palestinians, not the region -- and not the United States.\n","Now, I want to stress that there is an important point here: My job, above all, is to defend the United States of America -- to stand up for and defend our values and our interests in the world. And if we were to stand idly by and know that in doing so we are allowing a dangerous dynamic to take hold which promises greater conflict and instability to a region in which we have vital interests, we would be derelict in our own responsibilities.\n","Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U.S. friendship means the U.S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles -- even after urging again and again that the policy must change. Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect.\n","Israel’s permanent representative to the United Nations, who does not support a two-state solution, said after the vote last week, quote, “It was to be expected that Israel’s greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we share,” and veto this resolution. I am compelled to respond today that the United States did, in fact, vote in accordance with our values, just as previous U.S. administrations have done at the Security Council before us.\n","They fail to recognize that this friend, the United States of America, that has done more to support Israel than any other country, this friend that has blocked countless efforts to delegitimize Israel, cannot be true to our own values -- or even the stated democratic values of Israel -- and we cannot properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable two-state solution to be destroyed before our own eyes.\n","And that’s the bottom line: the vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two-state solution. That’s what we were standing up for: Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. That’s what we are trying to preserve for our sake and for theirs.\n","In fact, this Administration has been Israel’s greatest friend and supporter, with an absolutely unwavering commitment to advancing Israel’s security and protecting its legitimacy.\n","On this point, I want to be very clear: No American administration has done more for Israel’s security than Barack Obama’s. The Israeli prime minister himself has noted our, quote, “unprecedented” military and intelligence cooperation. Our military exercises are more advanced than ever. Our assistance for Iron Dome has saved countless Israeli lives. We have consistently supported Israel’s right to defend itself, by itself, including during actions in Gaza that sparked great controversy.\n","Time and again we have demonstrated that we have Israel’s back. We have strongly opposed boycotts, divestment campaigns, and sanctions targeting Israel in international fora, whenever and wherever its legitimacy was attacked, and we have fought for its inclusion across the UN system. In the midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we repeatedly increased funding to support Israel. In fact, more than one-half of our entire global Foreign Military Financing goes to Israel. And this fall, we concluded an historic $38 billion memorandum of understanding that exceeds any military assistance package the United States has provided to any country, at any time, and that will invest in cutting-edge missile defense and sustain Israel’s qualitative military edge for years to come. That’s the measure of our support.\n","This commitment to Israel’s security is actually very personal for me. On my first trip to Israel as a young senator in 1986, I was captivated by a special country, one that I immediately admired and soon grew to love. Over the years, like so many others who are drawn to this extraordinary place, I have climbed Masada, swum in the Dead Sea, driven from one Biblical city to another. I’ve also seen the dark side of Hizballah’s rocket storage facilities just across the border in Lebanon, walked through exhibits of the hell of the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, stood on the Golan Heights, and piloted an Israeli jet over the tiny airspace of Israel, which would make anyone understand the importance of security to Israelis. Out of those experiences came a steadfast commitment to Israel’s security that has never wavered for a single minute in my 28 years in the Senate or my four years as Secretary.\n","I have also often visited West Bank communities, where I met Palestinians struggling for basic freedom and dignity amidst the occupation, passed by military checkpoints that can make even the most routine daily trips to work or school an ordeal, and heard from business leaders who could not get the permits that they needed to get their products to the market and families who have struggled to secure permission just to travel for needed medical care.\n","And I have witnessed firsthand the ravages of a conflict that has gone on for far too long. I’ve seen Israeli children in Sderot whose playgrounds had been hit by Katyusha rockets. I’ve visited shelters next to schools in Kiryat Shmona that kids had 15 seconds to get to after a warning siren went off. I’ve also seen the devastation of war in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinian girls in Izbet Abed Rabo played in the rubble of a bombed-out building.\n","No children -- Israeli or Palestinian -- should have to live like that.\n","So, despite the obvious difficulties that I understood when I became Secretary of State, I knew that I had to do everything in my power to help end this conflict. And I was grateful to be working for President Obama, who was prepared to take risks for peace and was deeply committed to that effort.\n","Like previous U.S. administrations, we have committed our influence and our resources to trying to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict because, yes, it would serve American interests to stabilize a volatile region and fulfill America’s commitment to the survival, security and well-being of an Israel at peace with its Arab neighbors.\n","Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy.\n","The truth is that trends on the ground -- violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement expansion and the seemingly endless occupation -- they are combining to destroy hopes for peace on both sides and increasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that most people do not actually want.\n","Today, there are a number -- there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. They have a choice. They can choose to live together in one state, or they can separate into two states. But here is a fundamental reality: if the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic -- it cannot be both -- and it won’t ever really be at peace. Moreover, the Palestinians will never fully realize their vast potential in a homeland of their own with a one-state solution.\n","Now, most on both sides understand this basic choice, and that is why it is important that polls of Israelis and Palestinians show that there is still strong support for the two-state solution -- in theory. They just don’t believe that it can happen.\n","After decades of conflict, many no longer see the other side as people, only as threats and enemies. Both sides continue to push a narrative that plays to people’s fears and reinforces the worst stereotypes rather than working to change perceptions and build up belief in the possibility of peace.\n","And the truth is the extraordinary polarization in this conflict extends beyond Israelis and Palestinians. Allies of both sides are content to reinforce this with an us or -- “you’re with us or against us” mentality where too often anyone who questions Palestinian actions is an apologist for the occupation and anyone who disagrees with Israel policy is cast as anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic.\n","That’s one of the most striking realties about the current situation: This critical decision about the future -- one state or two states -- is effectively being made on the ground every single day, despite the expressed opinion of the majority of the people.\n","The status quo is leading towards one state and perpetual occupation, but most of the public either ignores it or has given up hope that anything can be done to change it. And with this passive resignation, the problem only gets worse, the risks get greater and the choices are narrowed.\n","This sense of hopelessness among Israelis is exacerbated by the continuing violence, terrorist attacks against civilians and incitement, which are destroying belief in the possibility of peace.\n","Let me say it again: There is absolutely no justification for terrorism, and there never will be.\n","And the most recent wave of Palestinian violence has included hundreds of terrorist attacks in the past year, including stabbings, shootings, vehicular attacks and bombings, many by individuals who have been radicalized by social media. Yet the murderers of innocents are still glorified on Fatah websites, including showing attackers next to Palestinian leaders following attacks. And despite statements by President Abbas and his party’s leaders making clear their opposition to violence, too often they send a different message by failing to condemn specific terrorist attacks and naming public squares, streets and schools after terrorists.\n","President Obama and I have made it clear to the Palestinian leadership countless times, publicly and privately, that all incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently condemned violence and terrorism, and even condemned the Palestinian leadership for not condemning it.\n","Far too often, the Palestinians have pursued efforts to delegitimize Israel in international fora. We have strongly opposed these initiatives, including the recent wholly unbalanced and inflammatory UNESCO resolution regarding Jerusalem. And we have made clear our strong opposition to Palestinian efforts against Israel at the ICC, which only sets back the prospects for peace.\n","And we all understand that the Palestinian Authority has a lot more to do to strengthen its institutions and improve governance.\n","Most troubling of all, Hamas continues to pursue an extremist agenda: they refuse to accept Israel’s very right to exist. They have a one-state vision of their own: all of the land is Palestine. Hamas and other radical factions are responsible for the most explicit forms of incitement to violence, and many of the images that they use are truly appalling. And they are willing to kill innocents in Israel and put the people of Gaza at risk in order to advance that agenda.\n","Compounding this, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, exacerbated by the closings of the crossings, is dire. Gaza is home to one of the world’s densest concentrations of people enduring extreme hardships with few opportunities. 1.3 million people out of Gaza’s population of 1.8 million are in need of daily assistance -- food and shelter. Most have electricity less than half the time and only 5 percent of the water is safe to drink. And yet despite the urgency of these needs, Hamas and other militant groups continue to re-arm and divert reconstruction materials to build tunnels, threatening more attacks on Israeli civilians that no government can tolerate.\n","Now, at the same time, we have to be clear about what is happening in the West Bank. The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements. The result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described as “more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history,” are leading in the opposite direction. They're leading towards one state. In fact, Israel has increasingly consolidated control over much of the West Bank for its own purposes, effectively reversing the transitions to greater Palestinian civil authority that were called for by the Oslo Accords.\n","I don’t think most people in Israel, and certainly in the world, have any idea how broad and systematic the process has become. But the facts speak for themselves. The number of settlers in the roughly 130 Israeli settlements east of the 1967 lines has steadily grown. The settler population in the West Bank alone, not including East Jerusalem, has increased by nearly 270,000 since Oslo, including 100,000 just since 2009, when President Obama's term began.\n","There's no point in pretending that these are just in large settlement blocks. Nearly 90,000 settlers are living east of the separation barrier that was created by Israel itself in the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state. And the population of these distant settlements has grown by 20,000 just since 2009. In fact, just recently the government approved a significant new settlement well east of the barrier, closer to Jordan than to Israel. What does that say to Palestinians in particular -- but also to the United States and the world -- about Israel’s intentions?\n","Let me emphasize, this is not to say that the settlements are the whole or even the primary cause of this conflict. Of course they are not. Nor can you say that if the settlements were suddenly removed, you’d have peace. Without a broader agreement, you would not. And we understand that in a final status agreement, certain settlements would become part of Israel to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 49 years -- we understand that -- including the new democratic demographic realities that exist on the ground. They would have to be factored in. But if more and more settlers are moving into the middle of Palestinian areas, it’s going to be just that much harder to separate, that much harder to imagine transferring sovereignty, and that is exactly the outcome that some are purposefully accelerating.\n","Let’s be clear: Settlement expansion has nothing to do with Israel's security. Many settlements actually increase the security burden on the Israeli Defense Forces. And leaders of the settler movement are motivated by ideological imperatives that entirely ignore legitimate Palestinian aspirations.\n","Among the most troubling illustrations of this point has been the proliferation of settler outposts that are illegal under Israel’s own laws. They’re often located on private Palestinian land and strategically placed in locations that make two states impossible. There are over 100 of these outposts. And since 2011, nearly one-third of them have been or are being legalized, despite pledges by past Israeli governments to dismantle many of them.\n","Now leaders of the settler movement have advanced unprecedented new legislation that would legalize most of those outposts. For the first time, it would apply Israeli domestic law to the West Bank rather than military law, which is a major step towards the process of annexation. When the law passed the first reading in the Israeli parliament, in the Knesset, one of the chief proponents said proudly -- and I quote -- “Today, the Israeli Knesset moved from heading towards establishing a Palestinian state towards Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria.” Even the Israeli attorney general has said that the draft law is unconstitutional and a violation of international law.\n","Now, you may hear from advocates that the settlements are not an obstacle to peace because the settlers who don’t want to leave can just stay in Palestine, like the Arab Israelis who live in Israel. But that misses a critical point, my friends. The Arab Israelis are citizens of Israel, subject to Israel’s law. Does anyone here really believe that the settlers will agree to submit to Palestinian law in Palestine?\n","Likewise, some supporters of the settlements argue that the settlers could just stay in their settlements and remain as Israeli citizens in their separate enclaves in the middle of Palestine, protected by the IDF. Well, there are over 80 settlements east of the separation barrier, many located in places that would make a continuous -- a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Does anyone seriously think that if they just stay where they are you could still have a viable Palestinian state?\n","Now, some have asked, “Why can’t we build in the blocs which everyone knows will eventually be part of Israel?” Well, the reason building there or anywhere else in the West Bank now results in such pushback is that the decision of what constitutes a bloc is being made unilaterally by the Israeli Government, without consultation, without the consent of the Palestinians, and without granting the Palestinians a reciprocal right to build in what will be, by most accounts, part of Palestine. Bottom line -- without agreement or mutuality, the unilateral choices become a major point of contention, and that is part of why we are here where we are.\n","You may hear that these remote settlements aren’t a problem because they only take up a very small percentage of the land. Well, again and again we have made it clear, it’s not just a question of the overall amount of land available in the West Bank. It’s whether the land can be connected or it’s broken up into small parcels, like a Swiss cheese, that could never constitute a real state. The more outposts that are built, the more the settlements expand, the less possible it is to create a contiguous state. So in the end, a settlement is not just the land that it’s on, it’s also what the location does to the movement of people, what it does to the ability of a road to connect people, one community to another, what it does to the sense of statehood that is chipped away with each new construction. No one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace.\n","But the problem, obviously, goes well beyond settlements. Trends indicate a comprehensive effort to take the West Bank land for Israel and prevent any Palestinian development there. Today, the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C -- much of which was supposed to be transferred to Palestinian control long ago under the Oslo Accords -- much of it is effectively off limits to Palestinian development. Most today has essentially been taken for exclusive use by Israel simply by unilaterally designating it as “state land” or including it within the jurisdiction of regional settlement councils. Israeli farms flourish in the Jordan River Valley, and Israeli resorts line the shores of the Dead Sea -- a lot of people don’t realize this -- they line the shore of the Dead Sea, where Palestinian development is not allowed. In fact, almost no private Palestinian building is approved in Area C at all. Only one permit was issued by Israel in all of 2014 and 2015, while approvals for hundreds of settlement units were advanced during that same period.\n","Moreover, Palestinian structures in Area C that do not have a permit from the Israeli military are potentially subject to demolition. And they are currently being demolished at an historically high rate. Over 1,300 Palestinians, including over 600 children, have been displaced by demolitions in 2016 alone -- more than any previous year.\n","So the settler agenda is defining the future of Israel. And their stated purpose is clear. They believe in one state: greater Israel. In fact, one prominent minister, who heads a pro-settler party, declared just after the U.S. election -- and I quote -- “the era of the two-state solution is over,” end quote. And many other coalition ministers publicly reject a Palestinian state. And they are increasingly getting their way, with plans for hundreds of new units in East Jerusalem recently announced and talk of a major new settlement building effort in the West Bank to follow.\n","So why are we so concerned? Why does this matter? Well, ask yourself these questions: What happens if that agenda succeeds? Where does that lead?\n","There are currently about 2.75 million Palestinians living under military occupation in the West Bank, most of them in Areas A and B -- 40 percent of the West Bank -- where they have limited autonomy. They are restricted in their daily movements by a web of checkpoints and unable to travel into or out of the West Bank without a permit from the Israelis.\n","So if there is only one state, you would have millions of Palestinians permanently living in segregated enclaves in the middle of the West Bank, with no real political rights, separate legal, education, and transportation systems, vast income disparities, under a permanent military occupation that deprives them of the most basic freedoms. Separate and unequal is what you would have. And nobody can explain how that works. Would an Israeli accept living that way? Would an American accept living that way? Will the world accept it?\n","If the occupation becomes permanent, over the time the Palestinian Authority could simply dissolve, turn over all the administrative and security responsibilities to the Israelis. What would happen then? Who would administer the schools and hospitals and on what basis? Does Israel want to pay for the billions of dollars of lost international assistance that the Palestinian Authority now receives? Would the Israel Defense Force police the streets of every single Palestinian city and town?\n","How would Israel respond to a growing civil rights movement from Palestinians, demanding a right to vote, or widespread protests and unrest across the West Bank? How does Israel reconcile a permanent occupation with its democratic ideals? How does the U.S. continue to defend that and still live up to our own democratic ideals?\n","Nobody has ever provided good answers to those questions because there aren’t any. And there would be an increasing risk of more intense violence between Palestinians and settlers, and complete despair among Palestinians that would create very fertile ground for extremists.\n","With all the external threats that Israel faces today, which we are very cognizant of and working with them to deal with, does it really want an intensifying conflict in the West Bank? How does that help Israel’s security? How does that help the region?\n","The answer is it doesn’t, which is precisely why so many senior Israeli military and intelligence leaders, past and present, believe the two-state solution is the only real answer for Israel’s long term security.\n","Now, one thing we do know: if Israel goes down the one state path, it will never have true peace with the rest of the Arab world, and I can say that with certainty. The Arab countries have made clear that they will not make peace with Israel without resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That’s not where their loyalties lie. That’s not where their politics are.\n","But there is something new here. Common interests in countering Iran’s destabilizing activities, and fighting extremists, as well as diversifying their economies have created real possibilities for something different is Israel takes advantage of the opportunities for peace. I have spent a great deal of time with key Arab leaders exploring this, and there is no doubt that they are prepared to have a fundamentally different relationship with Israel. That was stated in the Arab Peace Initiative, years ago. And in all my recent conversations, Arab leaders have confirmed their readiness, in the context of Israeli-Palestinian peace, not just to normalize relations but to work openly on securing that peace with significant regional security cooperation. It’s waiting. It’s right there.\n","Many have shown a willingness to support serious Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to take steps on the path to normalization to relations, including public meetings, providing there is a meaningful progress towards a two-state solution. My friends, that is a real opportunity that we should not allow to be missed.\n","And that raises one final question: Is ours the generation that gives up on the dream of a Jewish democratic state of Israel living in peace and security with its neighbors? Because that is really what is at stake.\n","Now, that is what informed our vote at the Security Council last week -- the need to preserve the two-state solution -- and both sides in this conflict must take responsibility to do that. We have repeatedly and emphatically stressed to the Palestinians that all incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently condemned all violence and terrorism, and we have strongly opposed unilateral efforts to delegitimize Israel in international fora.\n","We’ve made countless public and private exhortations to the Israelis to stop the march of settlements. In literally hundreds of conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have made clear that continued settlement activity would only increase pressure for an international response. We have all known for some time that the Palestinians were intent on moving forward in the UN with a settlements resolution, and I advised the prime minister repeatedly that further settlement activity only invited UN action.\n","Yet the settlement activity just increased, including advancing the unprecedented legislation to legalize settler outposts that the prime minister himself reportedly warned could expose Israel to action at the Security Council and even international prosecution before deciding to support it.\n","In the end, we could not in good conscience protect the most extreme elements of the settler movement as it tries to destroy the two-state solution. We could not in good conscience turn a blind eye to Palestinian actions that fan hatred and violence. It is not in U.S. interest to help anyone on either side create a unitary state. And we may not be able to stop them, but we cannot be expected to defend them. And it is certainly not the role of any country to vote against its own policies.\n","That is why we decided not to block the UN resolution that makes clear both sides have to take steps to save the two-state solution while there is still time. And we did not take this decision lightly. The Obama Administration has always defended Israel against any effort at the UN and any international fora or biased and one-sided resolutions that seek to undermine its legitimacy or security, and that has not changed. It didn’t change with this vote.\n","But remember it’s important to note that every United States administration, Republican and Democratic, has opposed settlements as contrary to the prospects for peace, and action at the UN Security Council is far from unprecedented. In fact, previous administrations of both political parties have allowed resolutions that were critical of Israel to pass, including on settlements. On dozens of occasions under George W. Bush alone, the council passed six resolutions that Israel opposed, including one that endorsed a plan calling for a complete freeze on settlements, including natural growth.\n","Let me read you the lead paragraph from a New York Times story dated December 23rd. I quote: “With the United States abstaining, the Security Council adopted a resolution today strongly deploring Israel’s handling of the disturbances in the occupied territories, which the resolution defined as, including Jerusalem. All of the 14 other Security Council members voted in favor.” My friends, that story was not written last week. It was written December 23rd, 1987, 26 years to the day that we voted last week, when Ronald Reagan was president.\n","Yet despite growing pressure, the Obama Administration held a strong line against UN action, any UN action, we were the only administration since 1967 that had not allowed any resolution to pass that Israel opposed. In fact, the only time in eight years the Obama Administration exercised its veto at the United Nations was against a one-sided settlements resolution in 2011. And that resolution did not mention incitement or violence.\n","Now let’s look at what’s happened since then. Since then, there have been over 30,000 settlement units advanced through some stage of the planning process. That’s right -- over 30,000 settlement units advanced notwithstanding the positions of the United States and other countries. And if we had vetoed this resolution just the other day, the United States would have been giving license to further unfettered settlement construction that we fundamentally oppose.\n","So we reject the criticism that this vote abandons Israel. On the contrary, it is not this resolution that is isolating Israel; it is the permanent policy of settlement construction that risks making peace impossible. And virtually every country in the world other than Israel opposes settlements. That includes many of the friends of Israel, including the United Kingdom, France, Russia -- all of whom voted in favor of the settlements resolution in 2011 that we vetoed, and again this year along with every other member of the council.\n","In fact, this resolution simply reaffirms statements made by the Security Council on the legality of settlements over several decades. It does not break new ground. In 1978, the State Department Legal Adviser advised the Congress on his conclusion that Israel’s government, the Israeli Government’s program of establishing civilian settlements in the occupied territory is inconsistent with international law, and we see no change since then to affect that fundamental conclusion.\n","Now, you may have heard that some criticized this resolution for calling East Jerusalem occupied territory. But to be clear, there was absolutely nothing new in last week’s resolution on that issue. It was one of a long line of Security Council resolutions that included East Jerusalem as part of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, and that includes resolutions passed by the Security Council under President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush. And remember that every U.S. administration since 1967, along with the entire international community, has recognized East Jerusalem as among the territories that Israel occupied in the Six-Day War.\n","Now, I want to stress this point: We fully respect Israel’s profound historic and religious ties to the city and to its holy sites. We’ve never questioned that. This resolution in no manner prejudges the outcome of permanent status negotiations on East Jerusalem, which must, of course, reflect those historic ties and the realities on the ground. That’s our position. We still support it.\n","We also strongly reject the notion that somehow the United States was the driving force behind this resolution. The Egyptians and Palestinians had long made clear to all of us -- to all of the international community -- their intention to bring a resolution to a vote before the end of the year, and we communicated that to the Israelis and they knew it anyway. The United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we put it forward. It was drafted by Egypt -- it was drafted and I think introduced by Egypt, which is one of Israel’s closest friends in the region, in coordination with the Palestinians and others.\n","And during the time of the process as it went out, we made clear to others, including those on the Security Council, that it was possible that if the resolution were to be balanced and it were to include references to incitement and to terrorism, that it was possible the United States would then not block it, that -- if it was balanced and fair. That’s a standard practice with resolutions at the Security Council. The Egyptians and the Palestinians and many others understood that if the text were more balanced, it was possible we wouldn’t block it. But we also made crystal clear that the President of the United States would not make a final decision about our own position until we saw the final text.\n","In the end, we did not agree with every word in this resolution. There are important issues that are not sufficiently addressed or even addressed at all. But we could not in good conscience veto a resolution that condemns violence and incitement and reiterates what has been for a long time the overwhelming consensus and international view on settlements and calls for the parties to start taking constructive steps to advance the two-state solution on the ground.\n","Ultimately, it will be up to the Israeli people to decide whether the unusually heated attacks that Israeli officials have directed towards this Administration best serve Israel’s national interests and its relationship with an ally that has been steadfast in its support, as I described. Those attacks, alongside allegations of U.S.-led conspiracy and other manufactured claims, distract attention from what the substance of this vote was really all about.\n","And we all understand that Israel faces very serious threats in a very tough neighborhood. Israelis are rightfully concerned about making sure that there is not a new terrorist haven right next door to them, often referencing what’s happened with Gaza, and we understand that and we believe there are ways to meet those needs of security. And Israelis are fully justified in decrying attempts to legitimize[1] their state and question the right of a Jewish state to exist. But this vote was not about that. It was about actions that Israelis and Palestinians are taking that are increasingly rendering a two-state solution impossible. It was not about making peace with the Palestinians now -- it was about making sure that peace with the Palestinians will be possible in the future.\n","Now, we all understand that Israel faces extraordinary, serious threats in a very tough neighborhood. And Israelis are very correct in making sure that there’s not a terrorist haven right on their border.\n","But this vote -- I can’t emphasize enough -- is not about the possibility of arriving at an agreement that’s going to resolve that overnight or in one year or two years. This is about a longer process. This is about how we make peace with the Palestinians in the future but preserve the capacity to do so.\n","So how do we get there? How do we get there, to that peace?\n","Since the parties have not yet been able to resume talks, the U.S. and the Middle East Quartet have repeatedly called on both sides to independently demonstrate a genuine commitment to the two-state solution -- not just with words, but with real actions and policies -- to create the conditions for meaningful negotiations.\n","We’ve called for both sides to take significant steps on the ground to reverse current trends and send a different message -- a clear message -- that they are prepared to fundamentally change the equation without waiting for the other side to act.\n","We have pushed them to comply with their basic commitments under their own prior agreements in order to advance a two-state reality on the ground.\n","We have called for the Palestinians to do everything in their power to stop violence and incitement, including publicly and consistently condemning acts of terrorism and stopping the glorification of violence.\n","And we have called on them to continue efforts to strengthen their own institutions and to improve governance, transparency, and accountability.\n","And we have stressed that the Hamas arms buildup and militant activities in Gaza must stop.\n","Along with our Quartet partners, we have called on Israel to end the policy of settlement construction and expansion, of taking land for exclusive Israeli use and denying Palestinian development.\n","To reverse the current process, the U.S. and our partners have encouraged Israel to resume the transfer of greater civil authority to the Palestinians in Area C, consistent with the transition that was called for by Oslo. And we have made clear that significant progress across a range of sectors, including housing, agriculture, and natural resources, can be made without negatively impacting Israel’s legitimate security needs. And we’ve called for significantly easing the movement and access restrictions to and from Gaza, with due consideration for Israel’s need to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\n","So let me stress here again: None of the steps that I just talked about would negatively impact Israel’s security.\n","Let me also emphasize this is not about offering limited economic measures that perpetuate the status quo. We’re talking about significant steps that would signal real progress towards creating two states.\n","That’s the bottom line: If we’re serious about the two-state solution, it’s time to start implementing it now. Advancing the process of separation now, in a serious way, could make a significant difference in saving the two-state solution and in building confidence in the citizens of both sides that peace is, indeed, possible. And much progress can be made in advance of negotiations that can lay the foundation for negotiations, as contemplated by the Oslo process. In fact, these steps will help create the conditions for successful talks.\n","Now, in the end, we all understand that a final status agreement can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties. We’ve said that again and again. We cannot impose the peace.\n","There are other countries in the UN who believe it is our job to dictate the terms of a solution in the Security Council. Others want us to simply recognize a Palestinian state, absent an agreement. But I want to make clear today, these are not the choices that we will make.\n","We choose instead to draw on the experiences of the last eight years, to provide a way forward when the parties are ready for serious negotiations. In a place where the narratives from the past powerfully inform and mold the present, it’s important to understand the history. We mark this year and next a series of milestones that I believe both illustrate the two sides of the conflict and form the basis for its resolution. It’s worth touching on them briefly.\n","A hundred and twenty years ago, the First Zionist Congress was convened in Basel by a group of Jewish visionaries, who decided that the only effective response to the waves of anti-Semitic horrors sweeping across Europe was to create a state in the historic home of the Jewish people, where their ties to the land went back centuries -- a state that could defend its borders, protect its people, and live in peace with its neighbors. That was the vision. That was the modern beginning, and it remains the dream of Israel today.\n","Nearly 70 years ago, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 finally paved the way to making the State of Israel a reality. The concept was simple: to create two states for two peoples -- one Jewish, one Arab -- to realize the national aspirations of both Jews and Palestinians. And both Israel and the PLO referenced Resolution 181 in their respective declarations of independence.\n","The United States recognized Israel seven minutes after its creation. But the Palestinians and the Arab world did not, and from its birth, Israel had to fight for its life. Palestinians also suffered terribly in the 1948 war, including many who had lived for generations in a land that had long been their home too. And when Israel celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2018, the Palestinians will mark a very different anniversary: 70 years since what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe.\n","Next year will also mark 50 years since the end of the Six-Day War, when Israel again fought for its survival. And Palestinians will again mark just the opposite: 50 years of military occupation. Both sides have accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242, which called for the withdrawal of Israel from territory that it occupied in 1967 in return for peace and secure borders, as the basis for ending the conflict.\n","It has been more than 20 years since Israel and the PLO signed their first agreement -- the Oslo Accords -- and the PLO formally recognized Israel. Both sides committed to a plan to transition much of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian control during permanent status negotiations that would put an end to their conflict. Unfortunately, neither the transition nor the final agreement came about, and both sides bear responsibility for that.\n","Finally, some 15 years ago, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia came out with the historic Arab Peace Initiative, which offered fully normalized relations with Israel when it made peace -- an enormous opportunity then and now, which has never been fully been embraced.\n","That history was critical to our approach to trying to find a way to resolve the conflict. And based on my experience with both sides over the last four years, including the nine months of formal negotiations, the core issues can be resolved if there is leadership on both sides committed to finding a solution.\n","In the end, I believe the negotiations did not fail because the gaps were too wide, but because the level of trust was too low. Both sides were concerned that any concessions would not be reciprocated and would come at too great a political cost. And the deep public skepticism only made it more difficult for them to be able to take risks.\n","In the countless hours that we spent working on a detailed framework, we worked through numerous formulations and developed specific bridging proposals, and we came away with a clear understanding of the fundamental needs of both sides. In the past two and a half years, I have tested ideas with regional and international stakeholders, including our Quartet partners. And I believe what has emerged from all of that is a broad consensus on balanced principles that would satisfy the core needs of both sides.\n","President Clinton deserves great credit for laying out extensive parameters designed to bridge gaps in advanced final status negotiations 16 years ago. Today, with mistrust too high to even start talks, we’re at the opposite end of the spectrum. Neither side is willing to even risk acknowledging the other’s bottom line, and more negotiations that do not produce progress will only reinforce the worst fears.\n","Now, everyone understands that negotiations would be complex and difficult, and nobody can be expected to agree on the final result in advance. But if the parties could at least demonstrate that they understand the other side’s most basic needs -- and are potentially willing to meet them if theirs are also met at the end of comprehensive negotiations -- perhaps then enough trust could be established to enable a meaningful process to begin.\n","It is in that spirit that we offer the following principles -- not to prejudge or impose an outcome, but to provide a possible basis for serious negotiations when the parties are ready. Now, individual countries may have more detailed policies on these issues -- as we do, by the way -- but I believe there is a broad consensus that a final status agreement that could meet the needs of both sides would do the following.\n","Principle number one: Provide for secure and recognized international borders between Israel and a viable and contiguous Palestine, negotiated based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed equivalent swaps.\n","Resolution 242, which has been enshrined in international law for 50 years, provides for the withdrawal of Israel from territory it occupied in 1967 in return for peace with its neighbors and secure and recognized borders. It has long been accepted by both sides, and it remains the basis for an agreement today.\n","As Secretary, one of the first issues that I worked out with the Arab League was their agreement that the reference in the Arab Peace Initiative to the 1967 lines would from now on include the concept of land swaps, which the Palestinians have acknowledged. And this is necessary to reflect practical realities on the ground, and mutually agreed equivalent swaps that will ensure that the agreement is fair to both sides.\n","There is also broad recognition of Israel’s need to ensure that the borders are secure and defensible, and that the territory of Palestine is viable and contiguous. Virtually everyone that I have spoken to has been clear on this principle as well: No changes by Israel to the 1967 lines will be recognized by the international community unless agreed to by both sides.\n","Principle two: Fulfill the vision of the UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of two states for two peoples, one Jewish and one Arab, with mutual recognition and full equal rights for all their respective citizens.\n","This has been the fundamental -- the foundational principle of the two-state solution from the beginning: creating a state for the Jewish people and a state for the Palestinian people, where each can achieve their national aspirations. And Resolution 181 is incorporated into the foundational documents of both the Israelis and Palestinians. Recognition of Israel as a Jewish state has been the U.S. position for years, and based on my conversations in these last months, I am absolutely convinced that many others are now prepared to accept it as well -- provided the need for a Palestinian state is also addressed.\n","We also know that there are some 1.7 million Arab citizens who call Israel their home and must now and always be able to live as equal citizens, which makes this a difficult issue for Palestinians and others in the Arab world. That’s why it is so important that in recognizing each other’s homeland -- Israel for the Jewish people and Palestine for the Palestinian people -- both sides reaffirm their commitment to upholding full equal rights for all of their respective citizens.\n","Principle number three: Provide for a just, agreed, fair, and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue, with international assistance, that includes compensation, options and assistance in finding permanent homes, acknowledgment of suffering, and other measures necessary for a comprehensive resolution consistent with two states for two peoples.\n","The plight of many Palestinian refugees is heartbreaking, and all agree that their needs have to be addressed. As part of a comprehensive resolution, they must be provided with compensation, their suffering must be acknowledged, and there will be a need to have options and assistance in finding permanent homes. The international community can provide significant support and assistance. I know we are prepared to do that, including in raising money to help ensure the compensation and other needs of the refugees are met, and many have expressed a willingness to contribute to that effort, particularly if it brings peace. But there is a general recognition that the solution must be consistent with two states for two peoples, and cannot affect the fundamental character of Israel.\n","Principle four: Provide an agreed resolution for Jerusalem as the internationally recognized capital of the two states, and protect and assure freedom of access to the holy sites consistent with the established status quo.\n","Now, Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue for both sides, and the solution will have to meet the needs not only of the parties, but of all three monotheistic faiths. That is why the holy sites that are sacred to billions of people around the world must be protected and remain accessible and the established status quo maintained. Most acknowledge that Jerusalem should not be divided again like it was in 1967, and we believe that. At the same time, there is broad recognition that there will be no peace agreement without reconciling the basic aspirations of both sides to have capitals there.\n","Principle five: Satisfy Israel’s security needs and bring a full end, ultimately, to the occupation, while ensuring that Israel can defend itself effectively and that Palestine can provide security for its people in a sovereign and non-militarized state.\n","Security is the fundamental issue for Israel together with a couple of others I’ve mentioned, but security is critical. Everyone understands that no Israeli Government can ever accept an agreement that does not satisfy its security needs or that risk creating an enduring security threat like Gaza transferred to the West Bank. And Israel must be able to defend itself effectively, including against terrorism and other regional threats. In fact, there is a real willingness by Egypt, Jordan, and others to work together with Israel on meeting key security challenges. And I believe that those collective efforts, including close coordination on border security, intelligence-sharing, joint cooperations -- joint operation, can all play a critical role in securing the peace.\n","At the same time, fully ending the occupation is the fundamental issue for the Palestinians. They need to know that the military occupation itself will really end after an agreed transitional process. They need to know they can live in freedom and dignity in a sovereign state while providing security for their population even without a military of their own. This is widely accepted as well. And it is important to understand there are many different ways without occupation for Israel and Palestine and Jordan and Egypt and the United States and others to cooperate in providing that security.\n","Now, balancing those requirements was among the most important challenges that we faced in the negotiations, but it was one where the United States has the ability to provide the most assistance. And that is why a team that was led by General John Allen, who is here, for whom I am very grateful for his many hours of effort, along with -- he is one of our foremost military minds, and dozens of experts from the Department of Defense and other agencies, all of them engaged extensively with the Israeli Defense Force on trying to find solutions that could help Israel address its legitimate security needs.\n","They developed innovative approaches to creating unprecedented, multi-layered border security; enhancing Palestinian capacity; enabling Israel to retain the ability to address threats by itself even when the occupation had ended. General Allen and his team were not suggesting one particular outcome or one particular timeline, nor were they suggesting that technology alone would resolve these problems. They were simply working on ways to support whatever the negotiators agreed to. And they did some very impressive work that gives me total confidence that Israel’s security requirements can be met.\n","Principle six: End the conflict and all outstanding claims, enabling normalized relations and enhanced regional security for all as envisaged by the Arab Peace Initiative. It is essential for both sides that the final status agreement resolves all the outstanding issues and finally brings closure to this conflict, so that everyone can move ahead to a new era of peaceful coexistence and cooperation. For Israel, this must also bring broader peace with all of its Arab neighbors. That is the fundamental promise of the Arab Peace Initiative, which key Arab leaders have affirmed in these most recent days.\n","The Arab Peace Initiative also envisions enhanced security for all of the region. It envisages Israel being a partner in those efforts when peace is made. This is the area where Israel and the Arab world are looking at perhaps the greatest moment of potential transformation in the Middle East since Israel’s creation in 1948. The Arab world faces its own set of security challenges. With Israeli-Palestinian peace, Israel, the United States, Jordan, Egypt -- together with the GCC countries -- would be ready and willing to define a new security partnership for the region that would be absolutely groundbreaking.\n","So ladies and gentlemen, that’s why it is vital that we all work to keep open the possibility of peace, that we not lose hope in the two-state solution, no matter how difficult it may seem -- because there really is no viable alternative.\n","Now, we all know that a speech alone won’t produce peace. But based on over 30 years of experience and the lessons from the past 4 years, I have suggested, I believe, and President Obama has signed on to and believes in a path that the parties could take: realistic steps on the ground now, consistent with the parties’ own prior commitments, that will begin the process of separating into two states; a political horizon to work towards to create the conditions for a successful final status talk; and a basis for negotiations that the parties could accept to demonstrate that they are serious about making peace.\n","We can only encourage them to take this path; we cannot walk down it for them. But if they take these steps, peace would bring extraordinary benefits in enhancing the security and the stability and the prosperity of Israelis, Palestinians, all of the nations of the region. The Palestinian economy has amazing potential in the context of independence, with major private sector investment possibilities and a talented, hungry, eager-to-work young workforce. Israel’s economy could enjoy unprecedented growth as it becomes a regional economic powerhouse, taking advantage of the unparalleled culture of innovation and trading opportunities with new Arab partners. Meanwhile, security challenges could be addressed by an entirely new security arrangement, in which Israel cooperates openly with key Arab states. That is the future that everybody should be working for.\n","President Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled that they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from the longstanding U.S. policies on settlements, Jerusalem, and the possibility of a two-state solution. That is for them to decide. That’s how we work. But we cannot -- in good conscience -- do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away.\n","This is a time to stand up for what is right. We have long known what two states living side by side in peace and security looks like. We should not be afraid to say so.\n","Now, I really began to reflect on what we have learned -- and the way ahead -- when I recently joined President Obama in Jerusalem for the state funeral for Shimon Peres. Shimon was one of the founding fathers of Israel who became one of the world’s great elder statesmen -- a beautiful man. I was proud to call him my friend, and I know that President Obama was as well.\n","And I remembered the first time that I saw Shimon in person -- standing on the White House lawn for the signing the historic Oslo Accords. And I thought about the last time, at an intimate one-on-one Shabbat dinner just a few months before he died, when we toasted together to the future of Israel and to the peace that he still so passionately believed in for his people.\n","He summed it up simply and eloquently, as only Shimon could, quote, “The original mandate gave the Palestinians 48 percent, now it’s down to 22 percent. I think 78 percent is enough for us.”\n","As we laid Shimon to rest that day, many of us couldn’t help but wonder if peace between Israelis and Palestinians might also be buried along with one of its most eloquent champions. We cannot let that happen. There is simply too much at stake -- for future generations of Israelis and Palestinians -- to give in to pessimism, especially when peace is, in fact, still possible.\n","We must not lose hope in the possibility of peace. We must not give in to those who say what is now must always be, that there is no chance for a better future. It is up to Israelis and Palestinians to make the difficult choices for peace, but we can all help. And for the sake of future generations of Israelis and Palestinians, for all the people of the region, for the United States, for all those around the world who have prayed for and worked for peace for generations, let’s hope that we are all prepared -- and particularly Israelis and Palestinians -- to make those choices now.\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john avlon: i want to share candid thoughts about an issue that has animated the foreign policy dialogue. he says the two-state solution is the only way to achieve peace between Israelis and palestinians and ensures future of freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people. and it is an important way of advancing United States interests in the region. we must have an honest, clear-eyed conversation about uncomfortable truths, difficult choices,  --------------------------\n","659 \n","Original text: Thank you all. Thank you so much. Let’s let our graduates rest themselves. You’ve worked hard for those seats!\n","Let me start by thanking President Johnson for that very gracious introduction, and for awarding me with this honorary degree from an extraordinary institution. I am proud to have this degree -- very proud. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n","I want to recognize Major General Williams; Congresswoman Sewell; Zachary; Kalauna; to all of the trustees, the faculty, the staff here at Tuskegee University. Thank you -- thank you so much for this warm welcome, this tremendous hospitality. And I'm so glad to be here.\n","Before I begin, I just want to say that my heart goes out to everyone who knew and loved Eric Marks, Jr. I understand he was such a talented young man, a promising aerospace engineer who was well on his way to achieving his dream of following in the footsteps of the Tuskegee Airmen. And Eric was taken from us far too soon. And our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with his family, his friends, and this entire community.\n","I also have to recognize the Concert Choir. Wow, you guys are good! Well done! Beautiful song. And I have to join in recognizing all the folks up in the stands -- the parents, siblings, friends -- so many others who have poured their love and support into these graduates every step of the way. Yeah, this is your day. Your day.\n","Now, on this day before Mother’s Day, I’ve got to give a special shout-out to all the moms here. Yay, moms! And I want you to consider this as a public service announcement for anyone who hasn’t bought the flowers or the cards or the gifts yet -- all right? I’m trying to cover you. But remember that one rule is “keep mom happy.” All right?\n","And finally, most of all, I want to congratulate the men and women of the Tuskegee University Class of 2015! T-U!\n","Audience: You know!\n","First Lady Obama: I love that. We can do that all day. I'm so proud of you all. And you look good. Well done!\n","You all have come here from all across the country to study, to learn, maybe have a little fun along the way -- from freshman year in Adams or Younge Hall -- to those late night food runs to The Coop. I did my research. To those mornings you woke up early to get a spot under The Shed to watch the Golden Tigers play. Yeah! I've been watching! At the White House we have all kinds of ways.\n","And whether you played sports yourself, or sang in the choir, or played in the band, or joined a fraternity or sorority -- after today, all of you will take your spot in the long line of men and women who have come here and distinguished themselves and this university.\n","You will follow alums like many of your parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles -- leaders like Robert Robinson Taylor, a groundbreaking architect and administrator here who was recently honored on a postage stamp. You will follow heroes like Dr. Boynton Robinson -- who survived the billy clubs and the tear gas of Bloody Sunday in Selma. The story of Tuskegee is full of stories like theirs -- men and women who came to this city, seized their own futures, and wound up shaping the arc of history for African Americans and all Americans.\n","And I’d like to begin today by reflecting on that history -- starting back at the time when the Army chose Tuskegee as the site of its airfield and flight school for black pilots.\n","Back then, black soldiers faced all kinds of obstacles. There were the so-called scientific studies that said that black men’s brains were smaller than white men’s. Official Army reports stated that black soldiers were “childlike,” “shiftless,” “unmoral and untruthful,” and as one quote stated, “if fed, loyal and compliant.”\n","So while the Airmen selected for this program were actually highly educated -- many already had college degrees and pilots licenses -- they were presumed to be inferior. During training, they were often assigned to menial tasks like housekeeping or landscaping. Many suffered verbal abuse at the hands of their instructors. When they ventured off base, the white sheriff here in town called them “boy” and ticketed them for the most minor offenses. And when they finally deployed overseas, white soldiers often wouldn’t even return their salutes.\n","Just think about what that must have been like for those young men. Here they were, trained to operate some of the most complicated, high-tech machines of their day -- flying at hundreds of miles an hour, with the tips of their wings just six inches apart. Yet when they hit the ground, folks treated them like they were nobody -- as if their very existence meant nothing.\n","Now, those Airmen could easily have let that experience clip their wings. But as you all know, instead of being defined by the discrimination and the doubts of those around them, they became one of the most successful pursuit squadrons in our military. They went on to show the world that if black folks and white folks could fight together, and fly together, then surely -- surely -- they could eat at a lunch counter together. Surely their kids could go to school together.\n","You see, those Airmen always understood that they had a “double duty” -- one to their country and another to all the black folks who were counting on them to pave the way forward. So for those Airmen, the act of flying itself was a symbol of liberation for themselves and for all African Americans.\n","One of those first pilots, a man named Charles DeBow, put it this way. He said that a takeoff was -- in his words -- “a never-failing miracle” where all “the bumps would smooth off… [you’re] in the air… out of this world… free.”\n","And when he was up in the sky, Charles sometimes looked down to see black folks out in the cotton fields not far from here -- the same fields where decades before, their ancestors as slaves. And he knew that he was taking to the skies for them -- to give them and their children something more to hope for, something to aspire to.\n","And in so many ways, that never-failing miracle -- the constant work to rise above the bumps in our path to greater freedom for our brothers and sisters -- that has always been the story of African Americans here at Tuskegee.\n","Just think about the arc of this university’s history. Back in the late 1800s, the school needed a new dormitory, but there was no money to pay for it. So Booker T. Washington pawned his pocket watch to buy a kiln, and students used their bare hands to make bricks to build that dorm -- and a few other buildings along the way.\n","A few years later, when George Washington Carver first came here for his research, there was no laboratory. So he dug through trash piles and collected old bottles, and tea cups, and fruit jars to use in his first experiments.\n","Generation after generation, students here have shown that same grit, that same resilience to soar past obstacles and outrages -- past the threat of countryside lynchings; past the humiliation of Jim Crow; past the turmoil of the Civil Rights era. And then they went on to become scientists, engineers, nurses and teachers in communities all across the country -- and continued to lift others up along the way.\n","And while the history of this campus isn’t perfect, the defining story of Tuskegee is the story of rising hopes and fortunes for all African Americans.\n","And now, graduates, it’s your turn to take up that cause. And let me tell you, you should feel so proud of making it to this day. And I hope that you’re excited to get started on that next chapter. But I also imagine that you might think about all that history, all those heroes who came before you -- you might also feel a little pressure, you know -- pressure to live up to the legacy of those who came before you; pressure to meet the expectations of others.\n","And believe me, I understand that kind of pressure. I’ve experienced a little bit of it myself. You see, graduates, I didn’t start out as the fully-formed First Lady who stands before you today. No, no, I had my share of bumps along the way.\n","Back when my husband first started campaigning for President, folks had all sorts of questions of me: What kind of First Lady would I be? What kinds of issues would I take on? Would I be more like Laura Bush, or Hillary Clinton, or Nancy Reagan? And the truth is, those same questions would have been posed to any candidate’s spouse. That’s just the way the process works. But, as potentially the first African American First Lady, I was also the focus of another set of questions and speculations; conversations sometimes rooted in the fears and misperceptions of others. Was I too loud, or too angry, or too emasculating? Or was I too soft, too much of a mom, not enough of a career woman?\n","Then there was the first time I was on a magazine cover -- it was a cartoon drawing of me with a huge afro and machine gun. Now, yeah, it was satire, but if I’m really being honest, it knocked me back a bit. It made me wonder, just how are people seeing me.\n","Or you might remember the on-stage celebratory fist bump between me and my husband after a primary win that was referred to as a “terrorist fist jab.” And over the years, folks have used plenty of interesting words to describe me. One said I exhibited “a little bit of uppity-ism.“ Another noted that I was one of my husband’s “cronies of color.” Cable news once charmingly referred to me as “Obama’s Baby Mama.”\n","And of course, Barack has endured his fair share of insults and slights. Even today, there are still folks questioning his citizenship.\n","And all of this used to really get to me. Back in those days, I had a lot of sleepless nights, worrying about what people thought of me, wondering if I might be hurting my husband’s chances of winning his election, fearing how my girls would feel if they found out what some people were saying about their mom.\n","But eventually, I realized that if I wanted to keep my sanity and not let others define me, there was only one thing I could do, and that was to have faith in God’s plan for me. I had to ignore all of the noise and be true to myself -- and the rest would work itself out.\n","So throughout this journey, I have learned to block everything out and focus on my truth. I had to answer some basic questions for myself: Who am I? No, really, who am I? What do I care about?\n","And the answers to those questions have resulted in the woman who stands before you today. A woman who is, first and foremost, a mom. Look, I love our daughters more than anything in the world, more than life itself. And while that may not be the first thing that some folks want to hear from an Ivy-league educated lawyer, it is truly who I am. So for me, being Mom-in-Chief is, and always will be, job number one.\n","Next, I’ve always felt a deep sense of obligation to make the biggest impact possible with this incredible platform. So I took on issues that were personal to me -- issues like helping families raise healthier kids, honoring the incredible military families I’d met on the campaign trail, inspiring our young people to value their education and finish college.\n","Now, some folks criticized my choices for not being bold enough. But these were my choices, my issues. And I decided to tackle them in the way that felt most authentic to me -- in a way that was both substantive and strategic, but also fun and, hopefully, inspiring.\n","So I immersed myself in the policy details. I worked with Congress on legislation, gave speeches to CEOs, military generals and Hollywood executives. But I also worked to ensure that my efforts would resonate with kids and families -- and that meant doing things in a creative and unconventional way. So, yeah, I planted a garden, and hula-hooped on the White House Lawn with kids. I did some Mom Dancing on TV. I celebrated military kids with Kermit the Frog. I asked folks across the country to wear their alma mater’s T-shirts for College Signing Day.\n","And at the end of the day, by staying true to the me I’ve always known, I found that this journey has been incredibly freeing. Because no matter what happened, I had the peace of mind of knowing that all of the chatter, the name calling, the doubting -- all of it was just noise. It did not define me. It didn’t change who I was. And most importantly, it couldn’t hold me back. I have learned that as long as I hold fast to my beliefs and values -- and follow my own moral compass -- then the only expectations I need to live up to are my own.\n","So, graduates, that’s what I want for all of you. I want you all to stay true to the most real, most sincere, most authentic parts of yourselves. I want you to ask those basic questions: Who do you want to be? What inspires you? How do you want to give back? And then I want you to take a deep breath and trust yourselves to chart your own course and make your mark on the world.\n","Maybe it feels like you’re supposed to go to law school -- but what you really want to do is to teach little kids. Maybe your parents are expecting you to come back home after you graduate -- but you’re feeling a pull to travel the world. I want you to listen to those thoughts. I want you to act with both your mind, but also your heart. And no matter what path you choose, I want you to make sure it’s you choosing it, and not someone else.\n","Because here’s the thing -- the road ahead is not going to be easy. It never is, especially for folks like you and me. Because while we’ve come so far, the truth is that those age-old problems are stubborn and they haven’t fully gone away. So there will be times, just like for those Airmen, when you feel like folks look right past you, or they see just a fraction of who you really are.\n","The world won’t always see you in those caps and gowns. They won’t know how hard you worked and how much you sacrificed to make it to this day -- the countless hours you spent studying to get this diploma, the multiple jobs you worked to pay for school, the times you had to drive home and take care of your grandma, the evenings you gave up to volunteer at a food bank or organize a campus fundraiser. They don't know that part of you.\n","Instead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world. And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be. We’ve both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives -- the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal events who assumed we were the “help” -- and those who have questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this country.\n","And I know that these little indignities are obviously nothing compared to what folks across the country are dealing with every single day -- those nagging worries that you’re going to get stopped or pulled over for absolutely no reason; the fear that your job application will be overlooked because of the way your name sounds; the agony of sending your kids to schools that may no longer be separate, but are far from equal; the realization that no matter how far you rise in life, how hard you work to be a good person, a good parent, a good citizen -- for some folks, it will never be enough.\n","And all of that is going to be a heavy burden to carry. It can feel isolating. It can make you feel like your life somehow doesn’t matter -- that you’re like the Invisible Man that Tuskegee grad Ralph Ellison wrote about all those years ago. And as we’ve seen over the past few years, those feelings are real. They’re rooted in decades of structural challenges that have made too many folks feel frustrated and invisible. And those feelings are playing out in communities like Baltimore and Ferguson and so many others across this country.\n","But, graduates, today, I want to be very clear that those feelings are not an excuse to just throw up our hands and give up. Not an excuse. They are not an excuse to lose hope. To succumb to feelings of despair and anger only means that in the end, we lose.\n","But here’s the thing -- our history provides us with a better story, a better blueprint for how we can win. It teaches us that when we pull ourselves out of those lowest emotional depths, and we channel our frustrations into studying and organizing and banding together -- then we can build ourselves and our communities up. We can take on those deep-rooted problems, and together -- together -- we can overcome anything that stands in our way.\n","And the first thing we have to do is vote. Hey, no, not just once in a while. Not just when my husband or somebody you like is on the ballot. But in every election at every level, all of the time. Because here is the truth -- if you want to have a say in your community, if you truly want the power to control your own destiny, then you’ve got to be involved. You got to be at the table. You’ve got to vote, vote, vote, vote. That’s it; that's the way we move forward. That’s how we make progress for ourselves and for our country.\n","That’s what’s always happened here at Tuskegee. Think about those students who made bricks with their bare hands. They did it so that others could follow them and learn on this campus, too. Think about that brilliant scientist who made his lab from a trash pile. He did it because he ultimately wanted to help sharecroppers feed their families. Those Airmen who rose above brutal discrimination -- they did it so the whole world could see just how high black folks could soar. That’s the spirit we’ve got to summon to take on the challenges we face today.\n","And you don’t have to be President of the United States to start addressing things like poverty, and education, and lack of opportunity. Graduates, today -- today, you can mentor a young person and make sure he or she takes the right path. Today, you can volunteer at an after-school program or food pantry. Today, you can help your younger cousin fill out her college financial aid form so that she could be sitting in those chairs one day. But just like all those folks who came before us, you’ve got to do something to lay the groundwork for future generations.\n","That pilot I mentioned earlier -- Charles DeBow -- he didn’t rest on his laurels after making history. Instead, after he left the Army, he finished his education. He became a high school English teacher and a college lecturer. He kept lifting other folks up through education. He kept fulfilling his “double duty” long after he hung up his uniform.\n","And, graduates, that’s what we need from all of you. We need you to channel the magic of Tuskegee toward the challenges of today. And here’s what I really want you to know -- you have got everything you need to do this. You’ve got it in you. Because even if you’re nervous or unsure about what path to take in the years ahead, I want you to realize that you’ve got everything you need right now to succeed. You’ve got it.\n","You’ve got the knowledge and the skills honed here on this hallowed campus. You’ve got families up in the stands who will support you every step of the way. And most of all, you’ve got yourselves -- and all of the heart, and grit, and smarts that got you to this day.\n","And if you rise above the noise and the pressures that surround you, if you stay true to who you are and where you come from, if you have faith in God’s plan for you, then you will keep fulfilling your duty to people all across this country. And as the years pass, you’ll feel the same freedom that Charles DeBow did when he was taking off in that airplane. You will feel the bumps smooth off. You’ll take part in that “never-failing miracle” of progress. And you’ll be flying through the air, out of this world -- free.\n","God bless you, graduates.\n","I can’t wait to see how high you soar.\n","Love you all. Very proud.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," thank you so much for this warm welcome, this tremendous hospitality.

They came home without a victory not because they'd been defeated, but because they'd been denied permission to win.\n","They were greeted by no parades, no bands, no waving of the flag they had so nobly served. There's been no \"thank you\" for their sacrifice. There's been no effort to honor and, thus, give pride to the families of more than 57,000 young men who gave their lives in that faraway war.\n","As the poet Laurence Binyon wrote, \"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them.\" Pride, of course, cannot wipe out the burden of grief borne by their families, but it can make that grief easier to bear. The pain will not be quite as sharp if they know their fellow citizens share that pain.\n","There's been little or no recognition of the gratitude we owe to the more than 300,000 men who suffered wounds in that war. John Stuart Mill said, \"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. A man who has nothing which he cares about more than his personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.\"\n","Back in 1970 Kenneth Y. Tomlinson wrote of what he had seen our young men do beyond and above the call of military duty in Vietnam, a marine from Texas on his way in at dawn from an all-night patrol stopping to treat huge sores on the back of an old Vietnamese man, an artilleryman from New Jersey spending his free time stacking sandbags at an orphanage to protect the children from mortar attacks, an Army engineer from California distributing toys he'd bought in Hong Kong to the orphans his unit had adopted. One senior military officer told Tomlinson, \"My hardest task is keeping track of the incurable humanitarianism of our troops.\"\n","None of the recent movies about that war have found time to show those examples of humanitarianism. In 1969 alone, United States Army volunteers helped construct 1,253 schools and 597 hospitals and dispensaries, contributing $300,000 from their own pockets. Marines from the Third Amphibious Force helped build 268 classrooms, 75 dispensaries, 78 churches, temples, and pagodas. Marines contributed $40,000 to ensure an education for 935 children. Air Force men gave their money and their own labor to 1,218 schools, medical facilities, and orphanages. Air Force doctors, dentists, and medics treated 390,000 Vietnamese in volunteeer programs.\n","At Hoa Khanh, Children's Hospital treated in that one year some 16,000 children, many of whom might have died without the hospital. One of the finest and most modern in the Far East, it was built and financed with money raised by combat marines. An l 1-year-old boy burned over three-quarters of his body was one of those saved. He interrupted the game he was playing with visiting marines to say, \"All my life, I will never forget this place and these healing people. Some way, I will repay them.\"\n","A 27-year-old chaplain from Springfield, Missouri, came upon an orphanage where 60 children were sleeping on the floor of a school and subsisting on one or two bowls of rice a day. He told some men of the American Division's Fifth Battalion, 46th Infantry, about what he'd seen. A veteran sergeant said, \"Don't worry, Chaplain. Those kids have just got themselves some new parents.\" And they had.\n","Army combat troops began sacking enemy food they had captured and shipping them back on returning helicopters. They found cots in a salvage dump, repaired them, and soon the children were sleeping in beds for the first time. One day, the cup was passed. Marines earmarked 10 percent of all poker winnings, and by the end of the year, the orphans were in a new building.\n","An Air Force pilot saw 240 lepers living in unimaginable filth. Soon there were volunteers from all branches of the military spending their weekends building houses at a hospital.\n","The stories go on and on. A Green Beret learned that a mother in a remote mountain village was having trouble in childbirth. He made his way to her home, carried her to a truck, and raced to Cam Ranh, where a Navy doctor delivered the baby. On Christmas he gave 1,500 orphans toothpaste, soap, candy, and nuts he'd collected from fellow servicemen.\n","Bob Hope, who visited our men there as he had in two previous wars, said of them, \"The number of our GI's who devote their free time, energy, and money to aid the Vietnamese would surprise you.\" And then he added, \"But maybe it wouldn't. I guess you know what kind of guys your sons and brothers and the kids next door are.\" Well, yes, we do know. I think we just let it slip our minds for a time. It's time to show our pride in them and to thank them.\n","In his book, \"The Bridges of Toko-Ri,\" novelist James Michener writes movingly of the heroes who fought in the Korean conflict. In the book's final scene an admiral stands on the darkened bridge of his carrier waiting for pilots he knows will never return from their mission. And as he waits he asks in the silent darkness, \"Where did we get such men?\" Almost a generation later, I asked that same question when our POW's were returned from savage captivity in Vietnam: \"Where did we find such men?\" We find them where we've always found them, in our villages and towns, on our city streets, in our shops, and on our farms.\n","I have one more Vietnam story, and the individual in this story was brought up on a farm outside of Cuero in De Witt County, Texas, and he is here today. Thanks to the Secretary of Defense, Cap Weinberger, I learned of his story, which had been overlooked or buried for several years. It has to do with the highest award our Nation can give, the Congressional Medal of Honor, given only for service above and beyond the call of duty.\n","Secretary Weinberger, would you please escort Sergeant Benavidez forward.\n","Ladies and gentlemen, we are honored to have with us today Master Sergeant Roy P. Benavidez, U.S. Army, Retired. Let me read the plain, factual military language of the citation that was lost for too long a time.\n","\"Master Sergeant Roy P. Benavidez, United States Army, Retired, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.\" Where there is a brave man, it is said, there is the thickest of the fight, there is the place of honor.\n","The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded in the name of the Congress the Medal of Honor to Master Sergeant Roy P. Benavidez United States Army, Retired for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty:\n","On May 2, 1968, Master Sergeant (then Staff Sergeant) Roy P. Benavidez distinguished himself by a series of daring and extremely valorous actions while assigned to Detachment B-56, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces, Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of May 2, 1968, a 12-man Special Forces Reconnaissance Team was inserted by helicopters in a dense jungle area west of Loc Ninh, Vietnam to gather intelligence information about confirmed large-scale enemy activity. This area was controlled and routinely patrolled by the North Vietnamese Army.\n","After a short period of time on the ground, the team met heavy enemy resistance, and requested emergency extraction. Three helicopters attempted extraction, but were unable to land due to intense enemy small arms and antiaircraft fire. Sergeant Benavidez was at the Forward Operating Base in Loc Ninh monitoring the operation by radio when these helicopters returned to off-load wounded crew members and to assess aircraft damage. Sergeant Benavidez voluntarily boarded a returning aircraft to assist in another extraction attempt. Realizing that all the team members were either dead or wounded and unable to move to the pickup zone, he directed the aircraft to a nearby clearing where he jumped from the hovering helicopter, and ran approximately 75 meters under withering small arms fire to the crippled team.\n","Prior to reaching the team's position, he was wounded in his right leg, face, and head. Despite these painful injuries, he took charge, repositioning the team members and directing their fire to facilitate the landing of an extraction aircraft, and the loading of wounded and dead team members. He then threw smoke canisters to direct the aircraft to the team's position.\n","Despite his severe wounds and under intense enemy fire, he carried and dragged half of the wounded team members to the awaiting aircraft. He then provided protective fire by running alongside the aircraft as it moved to pick up the remaining team members. As the enemy's fire intensified, he hurried to recover the body and the classified documents on the dead team leader. When he reached the team leader's body, Sergeant Benavidez was severely wounded by small arms fire in the abdomen and grenade fragments in his back.\n","At nearly the same moment, the aircraft pilot was mortally wounded, and his helicopter crashed. Although in extremely critical condition due to his multiple wounds, Sergeant Benavidez secured the classified documents and made his way back to the wreckage, where he aided the wounded out of the overturned aircraft, and gathered the stunned survivors into a defensive perimeter.\n","Under increasing enemy automatic weapons and grenade fire, he moved around the perimeter distributing water and ammunition to his weary men, reinstilling in them a will to live and fight. Facing a build-up of enemy opposition with a beleaguered team, Sergeant Benavidez mustered his strength, and began calling in tactical air strikes and directing the fire from supporting gunships, to suppress the enemy's fire and so permit another extraction attempt. He was wounded again in his thigh by small arms fire while administering first aid to a wounded team member just before another extraction helicopter was able to land.\n","His indomitable spirit kept him going as he began to ferry his comrades to the craft. On his second trip with the wounded, he was clubbed from behind by an enemy soldier. In the ensuing hand-to-hand combat, he sustained additional wounds to his head and arms before killing his adversary. He then continued under devastating fire to carry the wounded to the helicopter. Upon reaching the aircraft, he spotted and killed two enemy soldiers who were rushing the craft from an angle that prevented the aircraft door gunner from firing upon them.\n","With little strength remaining, he made one last trip to the perimeter to ensure that all classified material had been collected or destroyed, and to bring in the remaining wounded. Only then, in extremely serious condition from numerous wounds and loss of blood, did he allow himself to be pulled into the extraction aircraft.\n","Sergeant Benavidez' gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical straits, to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight men. His fearless personal leadership, tenacious devotion to duty, and extremely valorous actions in the face of overwhelming odds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflect the utmost credit on him and the United States Army. Ronald Reagan\n","Sergeant Benavidez, a nation grateful to you, and to all your comrades living and dead, awards you its highest symbol of gratitude for service above and beyond the call of duty, the Congressional Medal of Honor. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," a group of american fighting men came home without victory because they'd been defeated. there's been no effort to honor and give pride to the families of more than 57,000 young men who gave their lives in that faraway war. the pain will not be quite as sharp if they know their fellow citizens share that pain. --------------------------\n","661 \n","Original text: Good morning, everyone. I want to update you on three issues, four if you want to count the – my upcoming trip to Asia, including North Korea. First, the situation in Iraq; the second, a statement about the ruling this morning from the International Court of Justice; and finally, I want to talk about my effort to put America’s diplomatic corps back on the field.\n","To the situation in Iraq, Iran is the origin of the current threat to Americans in Iraq. It is to blame for the attacks against our mission in Basra and our embassy in Baghdad. Our intelligence in this regard is solid. We can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen supporting these attacks on the United States.\n","On Friday, I ordered the temporary relocation of U.S. Government personnel from our consulate general in Basra. I also warned the Iranian Government that we will hold it directly responsible for any harm to Americans or our diplomatic facilities, whether perpetrated by Iranian forces or by associated proxies or elements of those militias.\n","These latest destabilizing acts in Iraq are attempts by the Iranian regime to push back on our efforts to constrain its malign behavior. Clearly, they see our comprehensive pressure campaign as serious and succeeding, and we must be prepared for them to continue their attempts to hit back, especially after our full sanctions are re-imposed on the 4th of November.\n","The United States will continue to stand with the people of Iraq as they chart a future based on Iraqi interest, not those dictated by Iran. Even with the temporary relocation of our staff, we are supporting the delivery of clean water to the 750,000 residents in Basra.\n","Now let me turn to the ICJ ruling from today. I’m announcing that the United States is terminating the 1955 Treaty of Amity with Iran. This is a decision, frankly, that is 39 years overdue. In July, Iran brought a meritless case in the International Court of Justice alleging violations of the Treaty of Amity. Iran seeks to challenge the United States decision to cease participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to re-impose the sanctions that were lifted as a part of that deal. Iran is attempting to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions necessary to protect our national security. And Iran is abusing the ICJ for political and propaganda purposes and their case, as you can see from the decision, lacked merit.\n","Given Iran’s history of terrorism, ballistic missile activity, and other malign behaviors, Iran’s claims under the treaty are absurd. The court’s ruling today was a defeat for Iran. It rightly rejected all of Iran’s baseless requests. The court denied Iran’s attempt to secure broad measures to interfere with U.S. sanctions and rightly noted Iran’s history of noncompliance with its international obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n","With regard to the aspects of the court’s order focusing on potential humanitarian issues, we have been clear: Existing exceptions, authorizations, and licensing policies for humanitarian-related transactions and safety of flight will remain in effect. The United States has been actively engaged on these issues without regard to any proceeding before the ICJ. We’re working closely with the Department of the Treasury to ensure that certain humanitarian-related transactions involving Iran can and will continue.\n","That said, we’re disappointed that the court failed to recognize it has no jurisdiction to issue any order relating to these sanctions measures with the United States, which is doing its work on Iran to protect its own essential security interests.\n","In light of how Iran has hypocritically and groundlessly abused the ICJ as a forum for attacking the United States, I am therefore announcing today that the United States is terminating the Treaty of Amity with Iran. I hope that Iran’s leaders will come to recognize that the only way to secure a bright future for its country is by ceasing their campaign of terror and destruction around the world.\n","The third item, putting the diplomatic team from the United States Department of State back on the field: I want to talk about the fact that there are 65 nominees now sitting with the United States Senate. That’s over a quarter of all the senior-level confirmable positions that the United States Department of State is tasked with using to achieve its diplomatic outcomes. And I want every single American to know that what Senator Menendez and members of the Senate are doing to hold back American diplomacy rests squarely on their shoulders.\n","Both Republicans and Democrats agree that a fully staffed State Department is critical to American national security. Indeed, when I was before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Menendez told me, quote, “The problem is we have an emaciated State Department under this administration,” end of quote. Well, we’ve now done our part to fix that. He now needs to do his, and the Senate needs to do its part.\n","These candidates are quality candidates. They are not sitting on the Senate floor because of objections with respect to their quality, their professionalism, or their excellence and their ability to deliver American foreign policy. Wave after wave of these extremely qualified nominees have been sent to the United States Senate.\n","Let me give a few examples: John Richmond. He’s been stuck for 85 days while we try to make necessary progress on combating human trafficking, a priority for this administration and a shared priority of Senator Menendez. We have Kim Breier, the President’s nominee to head up Western Hemisphere Affairs, stuck for 204 days while the crisis in Venezuela and Central America continues to rage. David Schenker, the President’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Near East Affairs, is held up while the humanitarian crisis continues and while Iran continues to undermine peace and stability throughout the Middle East.\n","Russia is seeking to prey on our elections, but Ellen McCarthy, a 30-year veteran of the Intelligence Community and the President’s choice to head the Bureau of Intelligence and Research sits on the Senate floor.\n","As American forces are engaged against terrorists around the world, Clarke Cooper, an experienced military professional designated to lead the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs waits for the Foreign Relations Committee to act on his nomination.\n","You should know that as a former member, I completely appreciate the Senate’s advice and consent role and their duty to conduct oversight. And I understand their need to be fair and honest brokers. But that’s not what is being engaged in. We need these people. What’s happening is unprecedented. We have members of the United States Senate who – for whom partisanship has now driven delay and obstruction of getting America’s diplomatic corps into every corner of the world.\n","It will impact our operations, our ability. We don’t have a COO, the under secretary for management now coming on two years with no one filling that position, and enormous, complex operations keeping our diplomats safe around the world don’t have a senior leader to manage those operations. There are real, direct impacts of not having these people confirmed and I implore the United States Senate to take these quality, talented people and allow them to do what it is they have agreed to do on behalf of the United States.\n","And with that, I’m happy to take a couple questions.\n","Ms. Nauert: [Inaudible]. We’ll start with Lesley from Reuters.\n","Question: Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, does the ruling of the World Court, does that have any practical impact on what the U.S. is – on U.S. sanctions, number one? And number two, what other – what assurances can you give that this will not impact any humanitarian aid? Because the Court actually said that it was not enough, that the U.S. – that the U.S.’s assurances were not adequate.\n","Secretary Pompeo: The United States has been very clear: We will continue to make sure that we are providing humanitarian assistance in a way that delivers for the people we have spoken very clearly about, the Iranian people. We care deeply about them. We will make sure that we continue to afford the flexibility so that that assistance can be needed.\n","Having said that, the choices that are being made inside of Iran today – to use money to foment terror around the world, to launch ballistic missiles into airports throughout the Middle East, to arm proxy militias in Iraq and in Syria and in Lebanon – those are dollars that the Iranian leadership is squandering. They could be providing humanitarian assistance to their own people but have chosen instead a different path, a path of revolutionary effort around the world showing utter disregard for the humanitarian needs of their own people.\n","Ms. Nauert: Nick Kalman from Fox.\n","Question: I wanted to ask about North Korea, Mr. Secretary. The North Koreans have a new commentary saying the end-of-war declaration issue should’ve been resolved half a century ago in light of your trip coming up. Will it be resolved this weekend? And if not, what would be the reasoning against offering this?\n","Secretary Pompeo: So I’m not going to comment on the progress of the negotiations on the end-of-war declaration or any other items, only to say this: I’m very happy to be going back to get another chance to continue to advance the commitment that Chairman Kim and President Trump made back in Singapore in the second week of June. I’m optimistic that we’ll come away from that with better understandings, deeper progress, and a plan forward not only for the summit between the two leaders, but for us to continue the efforts to build out a pathway for denuclearization.\n","Ms. Nauert: Next question, Michel from Al Hurra.\n","Question: Yeah, thank you. Mr. Secretary, Russia has delivered today S-300 systems to Syria. You said in the past that it’s a serious escalation. Are you planning to take any measures in this regard? And my second question on Iraq. Any comment on the election of Barham Salih as the president and the designation of Adel Abdul Mahdi as the prime minister?\n","SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ve had a chance to speak with the new speaker of the house and the new president. I’ve not had a chance to speak with the new – the president designee as of yet. I hope to do so. And I am equally hopeful that they will follow through on the commitments that they made when we spoke. These are people that we know pretty well. They’ve been around the Iraqi Government scene for some time, and what we talked about was building out an Iraqi Government that was an Iraqi Government of national unity that was interested in the welfare and future good fortunes for the Iraqi people, not controlled by the Islamic Republic of Iran. It’s something that was a shared set of objectives, and I’m very, very hopeful that we can continue to work with the Iraqi people and the soon-to-be-completed, formed new Iraqi Government to deliver against that.\n","Your first question was about the S-300. I’m certainly not going to comment on our intention on how we will address that, but my comments before were true. Having the Russians deliver the S-300 into Syria presents greater risk to all of those in the affected areas and to stability in the Middle East. We consider this a very serious escalation.\n","QUESTION: Thank you.\n","Ms. Nauert: Last question. Kylie from CBS News.\n","Question: Hi, Secretary. Question. Can you explain to us a little bit the practical reality of the U.S. terminating the amity with Iran, and just how we’ll see that play out? And then secondly, just because we’re going to North Korea, is there any timeframe for what the U.S. wants to achieve given that last week we heard President Trump say that they’re not – the U.S. is not playing a time game, but you said that you want rapid denuclearization of North Korea completed by January 2021?\n","Secretary Pompeo: Those are entirely consistent with each other. We want it fast, but we’re not going to play the time game. My comment about 2021 was not mine. I repeated it, but it was a comment that had been made by the leaders who’d had their inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang. They’d talked about 2021 when they were gathered there, and so I was simply reiterating this as a timeline that they were potentially prepared to agree to.\n","President Trump’s comments are exactly right. This is a long-term problem. This has been outstanding for decades. We’ve made more progress than has been made in an awfully long time. And importantly, we’ve done so in a condition which continues to give us the opportunity to achieve the final goal, that is the economic sanctions continue to remain in place, the core proposition; the thing which will give us the capacity to deliver denuclearization isn’t changing. If you heard the comments at the UN Security Council, complete unanimity about the need for those to stay in place.\n","The Russians and the Chinese had some ideas about how we might begin to think about a time when it would be appropriate to reduce them, but to a country, they were supportive of maintaining the UN Security Council resolutions and the sanctions that underlay them. That is a – that is a global commitment that I’m not sure there’s many issues in the world you can find such unanimity. And so my efforts this week will be one more step along the way towards achieving what the UN Security Council has directed the North Koreans to do.\n","Question: And the practical fallout from pulling out of the treaty?\n","Secretary Pompeo: We’ll see what the practical fallout is. The Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time. We ought to have pulled out of it decades ago. Today marked a useful point with the decision that was made this morning from the ICJ. This marked a useful point for us to demonstrate the absolute absurdity of the Treaty of Amity between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n","Ms. Nauert: Thank you, everybody. We have to go now.\n","Secretary Pompeo: Thanks, everyone. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," iran is the origin of the current threat to Americans in Iraq. it is to blame for the attacks against our mission in Basra and our embassy in Baghdad. we can see the hand of ayatollah and his henchmen supporting these attacks on the United States. --------------------------\n","662 \n","Original text: Seinfeld: Thank you.

It was so good that, as a direct result, I have been asked to be here tonight to present the award for outstanding documentary feature. And I love documentaries. I find them to have a very real quality.\n","And I know all the nominees are excited, because when you are nominated, you are being told, \"We think you might be the best. Might.

This is a very special moment, and it's made more special by each of you participating here this morning. And I want to thank you -- especially my family and friends who have made it very special for me.\n","But I also want to thank the former enshrinees seated to my right, and want you guys to know that from my heart that -- my career, players of my era, the players that play today -- we stood on your shoulders, and we thank you for what you've done in creating the greatest football game -- the greatest sport in the world. Thank you.\n","Thank each of you for the honor of this moment.\n","I want to share this honor equally with my wife, my best friend. Words could not possibly express, or adequately express, or time allow, to say \"Thank you\" to my wife, Terry. Thank you. You really have made every good thing possible in my life.\n","I also want to thank my children: Kyle and Casie and Kelly and Kramer -- that you guys are my most treasured possession, most valuable trophies in my life. Thank each of you.\n","You know, my most significant accomplishments have always come in the context of a team. And I also want to thank my teammates in victory and defeat, especially Jim Zorn and Dave Krieg, who are both here this afternoon.\n","But I also want to share with you, briefly this afternoon, the message of my life. My story, like so many others, is a story of mentors -- of people who challenged me when I questioned myself, of people who believed in me against all the evidence: my mother who never missed a game and never missed a practice -- in fact, she talked me out of quitting football when I was a sophomore in high school; my grandfather, who stepped into the gap when my folks were divorced; my coaches, Jerry Rhome, who rescued me off of the waiver wire in 1976; Steve Moore and Chuck Knox; Jerry Potter, my high school coach, who had the wisdom to demote me to wide receiver. They've taught me the game of football and the meaning of leadership. When I close my eyes, I can still hear their voices, hear their whistles. They still shape my character and my life.\n","I was one of those players, as you know, who was labeled early as \"too small\" and \"too slow.\" I came to depend on people who saw me actually as bigger and faster than I really was. We all need people who believe in us. They expand the boundaries we place on our own lives. In my case, their influence did more than improve my performance in this great game; it filled a hollowness in my own life I could not explain, or even understand.\n","When a child grows up today without a father, there's an empty place where someone must stand, providing an example of character and confidence. If no one takes that place, a child can live in a shadow all their lives. Their emptiness is often filled by despair, by anger, or even violence. This commonplace tragedy has become the central problem of our society; it has caused an epidemic of secret suffering.\n","But if someone takes that place, a child can escape the shadows. He can find confidence and courage and conscience -- and perhaps even find his way to the football Hall of Fame.\n","I have the extraordinary respect for men and women who accept that responsibility and play that role in young life's [sic] today. They leave an influence more lasting than any law. The really heroic people are not those who break records. The really heroic people are those who can mend a broken spirit. My accomplishment today is a tribute to those people in my life who were willing to do that for me.\n","Finally, I want to say that whatever favor I have gained is ultimately due to the God I serve. God's grace is particularly clear in life's great challenges and in life's great moments. This is one of those moments for me, and I owe a debt of gratitude that is hopeless to repay.\n","My faith is not a system of belief, not a code of honor, but a relationship with Jesus Christ, who provided his love in a lonely death. I could explore God's grace to me forever and never reach its depth and never find its limits. His blessing is the ultimate explanation for whatever is praiseworthy in my career and in my life. In football, I found temporary achievements and lasting relationships. It tested and shaped my character.\n","I've seen the glory of this game. To be here in this place, at this moment, for this reason, is an honor beyond all my expectations. I owe you my deepest thanks.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," thank you for bringing the greatest football game to the world. thanks to my wife, my best friend, for the honor of this moment, i want to share with you the message of my life, briefly this afternoon. --------------------------\n","664 \n","Original text: Thank you Steve for that introduction, and thanks to the New America Foundation for hosting today’s event.\n","I want to recognize New America for its thought leadership on communications and spectrum issues, in particular, the work of Michael Calabrese on your Wireless Future Program and Sascha Meinrath on the Open Technology Initiative.\n","New America has filed extensive and specific comments on our National Broadband Plan. Everyone here should know that we took them to heart, and if you have a problem with the substance of my remarks or the Plan, you should take it up with Steve Coll, not me.\n","As many of you know, as part of the Recovery Act, Congress and the President charged the FCC with developing a strategy to bring high-speed Internet and its benefits to all Americans. Less than a month from now, we will deliver this National Broadband Plan to Congress.\n","In the past, I’ve likened the development of this plan to running a marathon at a sprinter’s pace. But as I was watching my required 3 hours of NBC last night, I realized that a more apt sports metaphor for the National Broadband Plan would be the Winter Olympics.\n","Let me explain.\n","First, the National Broadband Plan will be the culmination of a tremendous amount of hard work and effort. For months a dedicated team has been working around the clock. A team that includes engineers, economists, and entrepreneurs; lawyers, academics, analysts, and consumer advocates; some of the very best public servants in the business, drawing from every bureau at the FCC. They have been driven by the imperative of developing a meaningful plan for U.S. global leadership in broadband to create jobs and economic growth; to unleash new waves of innovation and investment; and to improve education, health care, energy efficiency, public safety, and the vibrancy of our democracy. Hats off to this world-class team.\n","The second way the National Broadband Plan is like the Olympics -- the ultimate goal is to earn a gold medal for the United States. The challenge is: we are lagging behind when it comes to broadband. Multiple studies have the U.S. ranked outside the top 10 when it comes to broadband penetration and speed. While some people take exception with those studies, few would suggest that we are leading the world in broadband, or are even as close as we should be. And I can tell you from speaking to my counterparts in other countries, the rest of the world is not sitting around waiting for us to catch up.\n","Consider a study that Intel CEO Paul Ottelini described yesterday. The study ranked the U.S. 6th in the world in innovative competitiveness, and 40th out of the 40 countries ranked in “the rate of change in innovative capacity.” The first of those rankings is enough of a concern. That last-place statistic is the canary in the coal mine. The costs of our failure to lead are high. As IBM CEO Sam Palmisano recently put it, “Without pervasive broadband, our country will not be prepared for a new world that is increasingly built on the fusion of the physical and the digital.”\n","For U.S. businesses to lead across the globe and for innovation to flourish at home, we need to invest in the infrastructure of the future: broadband. We need robust and open broadband, flourishing with applications and services that we can only begin to imagine. We have extraordinary capacity in the U.S. to build the best computers, chips, and applications in the world. But we are at risk of that asset being wasted if we don’t have great broadband infrastructure, wired and wireless. It would be like having the technology for great electric cars, but terrible roads. When it comes to mobile broadband, our goal is clear: To benefit all Americans and promote our global competitiveness, the U.S. must have the fastest, most robust, and most extensive mobile broadband networks, and the most innovative mobile broadband marketplace in the world.\n","This will be a core goal of our National Broadband Plan.\n","To meet that goal, our plan is ambitious but straightforward: Accelerate the broad deployment of mobile broadband by moving to recover and reallocate spectrum; update our 20th century spectrum policies to reflect 21st century technologies and opportunities; remove barriers to broadband buildout, lower the cost of deployment, and promote competition. No area of the broadband ecosystem holds more promise for transformational innovation than mobile. Breakthrough new devices that put the power of a “PC-in-your-pocket,” combined with billions in network investments have liberated broadband from the desktop and made it possible to imagine a world where the Internet is available to anyone, anywhere, anytime.\n","And some of America’s greatest innovators have clearly been working overtime to seize the opportunity, as the iPad and the Kindle attest. While mobile broadband is still in the preliminaries (to stick with the Olympics theme), we’ve seen enough to say some things definitively: This is a sector that can fundamental transform our society and economy.\n","Mobile broadband can be about job creation and economic growth.\n","Jobs in the mobile network economy -- jobs building out and managing extensive mobile broadband networks. And jobs in the mobile apps economy. According to Gartner research, $4.2 billion in mobile applications were sold last year -- up from essentially zero just a couple of years ago. The number of apps has crossed 150,000. Studies show that increases in mobile broadband adoption translate into increases in economic growth and job creation.\n","Mobile broadband can be about education.\n","Last week, a New York Times article described an Arizona school district that installed Wi-Fi on one if its school buses. The bus was instantly transformed into a rolling study hall. And if anyone ever doubts the power of mobile broadband tell them this: the driver says that bus of high school kids is now quiet.\n","Mobile broadband can be about healthcare.\n","Mobile medicine takes remote monitoring to a new level. A patient’s heart rhythm can be monitored continuously, regardless of her whereabouts, and diabetics can receive continuous, flexible insulin delivery through real-time glucose monitoring sensors that transmit date to wearable insulin pumps.\n","Mobile broadband can be about energy.\n","With mobile broadband, consumers and businesses can utilize Smart Grid-enabled information services. A whole new world of “energy apps” can adjust lights, heating, and cooling from a smartphone or netbook, saving electricity, saving our environment, and saving money to boot.\n","Mobile broadband can be about public safety.\n","With mobile broadband, EMTs can beam images of a patient wirelessly from the road so that emergency room doctors can review them while the patient is in transit. First responders can also access a patient’s medical records almost instantaneously when they arrive on the scene.\n","Mobile broadband can about 21st century government and enhanced civic engagement.\n","During the recent snowstorm, Howard County, Maryland equipped all 120 of its snow plows with GPS receivers. A website displayed the trucks’ positions and the status of county streets, and county residents could see which streets had been plowed, salted or sanded. Families who lost power used their smartphones as a lifeline, coordinating cleanup efforts.\n","We’re all seeing the ways in which mobile services like Twitter can enhance participation in public life – and of course that’s just the beginning. And so these early days of mobile broadband demonstrate tremendous opportunities.\n","But they also reveal serious challenges to America’s hopes for global leadership in mobile. For starters, although the potential of mobile broadband is limitless, its oxygen supply is not. Spectrum -- our airwaves -- really is the oxygen of mobile broadband service. Without sufficient spectrum, we will starve mobile broadband of the nourishment it needs to thrive as a platform for innovation, job creation and economic growth.\n","And the fact is America is facing a looming spectrum crunch. As part of our broadband process the FCC received a letter from over a hundred companies – including Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola, and Verizon -- entities representing billions in investment and millions of American jobs. These companies were united in telling the FCC [quote]: “Without more spectrum, America’s global leadership in innovation and technology is threatened.”\n","Let’s look at some numbers. Mobile data usage is not just growing, it’s exploding. AT&T reports that its mobile data traffic is up 5,000% over the past three years. That’s not surprising when you consider that a typical smartphone generates 30 times the traffic of a traditional data-enabled phone -- and a netbook generates 450 times more traffic. According to Cisco, North American wireless networks carried 17 petabytes per month in 2009. By 2014, they are projected to carry 740 petabytes per month. Now even if you think a petabyte is something that sends you to the emergency room, you know that that’s a game-changing trajectory. There is spectrum coming to market. Counting 2008’s 700 MHz auction, the FCC in recent years has authorized a 3-fold increase in commercial spectrum for mobile broadband. But that increase will not allow us to keep pace with an estimated 30-fold increase in traffic.\n","While the spectrum crunch is a serious obstacle threatening the growth of mobile broadband, it is not the only one.\n","Wireless providers also face red tape and needless barriers, which slow deployment and increase the costs of investment. The costs of obtaining permits and leasing pole attachments and rights of way can amount to 20 percent of fiber deployment, which is necessary for wireless networks as well as wired networks. With our tower-siting shot-clock order in November, the Commission has already begun taking action to cut red tape, lower the costs of investment, and accelerate network deployments -- but more needs to be done.\n","Another serious problem is that the mobile broadband revolution is not reaching all Americans. Many homes are technically passed by mobile broadband networks, but still cannot get a clear signal inside their home. And a mobile divide is an increasingly important part of the digital divide. In Alaska, for example, 23% of its population doesn’t have access to 3G mobile broadband. In West Virginia, at least 29% of its population lacks coverage. We also see disproportionately low adoption rates among certain populations, such as persons with disabilities.\n","A final major issue: We are still way behind on communications interoperability for first responders, years after a call to action was issued by the 9/11 Commission. And the situation is even worse when it comes to mobile broadband for first responders. While a portion of the 700 MHz spectrum has been allocated for public safety broadband use, our country still needs to build out that network.\n","With our National Broadband Plan, the Commission will lay out its most dramatic actions yet to position America as a global leader in mobile broadband innovation. What are we going to do? The Broadband Plan will represent the first important step in what, my colleague, FCC Commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker, has urged us to pursue: “an ongoing strategic planning process on spectrum policy – to ensure that the agency’s stewardship of the public’s airwaves is smart, future-oriented, and serves as an ongoing engine of innovation and investment.”\n","First, we are going to announce a game plan to unleash more spectrum for mobile broadband. The National Broadband Plan will set a goal of freeing up 500 Megahertz of spectrum over the next decade. We will work closely with NTIA to do so. One of the best ways for us to achieve the right balance in the supply and demand of spectrum is to establish market-based mechanisms that enable spectrum intended for the commercial marketplace to flow to the uses the market values most.\n","The Broadband Plan will recommend one such mechanism. It will propose a “Mobile Future Auction” -- an auction permitting existing spectrum licensees, such as television broadcasters in spectrum-starved markets, to voluntarily relinquish spectrum in exchange for a share of auction proceeds, and allow spectrum sharing and other spectrum efficiency measures.\n","Now, I’ve mentioned broadcast spectrum – so let me be clear: the recommendation is for a voluntary program. While overwhelmingly -- roughly 90% -- of Americans receive their broadcast TV programming in most major markets through cable wires or satellite signals, there are still millions of Americans who receive TV through over-the-air antenna TV. Broadcasters would be able to continue to serve their communities with free over-the-air local news, information, and entertainment; and they would be able to experiment mobile TV. The Mobile Future Auction would allow broadcasters to elect to participate in a mechanism that could save costs for broadcasters while also being a major part of the solution to one of our country’s most significant challenges.\n","Why look at broadcast spectrum as a major part of our spectrum strategic planning?\n","First, a broad range of analysts, companies and trade associations participating in our Broadband proceeding agree that a clear candidate for allocation is spectrum in the broadcast TV bands. They point to a massive amount of unlocked value in that spectrum, which has characteristics that make it particularly suitable for mobile broadband – one study suggests that as much as $50 billion in value could be unlocked if we adopted policies to convert some of the broadcast spectrum to mobile broadband. This suggests that there are inefficiencies in the current allocation.\n","A second reason is that the highly valuable spectrum currently allocated for broadcast television is not being used efficiently – indeed, much is not being used at all. About 300 megahertz of spectrum have been set aside for broadcast TV. In markets with less than 1 million people, only 36 megahertz are typically used for broadcasting. In cities with more than 1 million people, on average about 100 megahertz are used. Even in our very largest cities, at most only about 150 megahertz out of 300 megahertz are used. This is true even after the recent reallocation for digital television, which freed up some spectrum for mobile broadband. New technologies allow – indeed, they require – new strategic planning to ensure the most efficient use of spectrum, a vital public resource, especially given our broadband needs.\n","Because of the billions of dollars of unlocked value in broadcast spectrum, and because of the current inefficient spectrum allocation, the Mobile Future Auction is a win-win proposal: for broadcasters, who win more flexibility to pursue business models to serve their local communities; and for the public, which wins more innovation in mobile broadband services, continued free, over-the-air television, and the benefits of the proceeds of new and substantial auction revenues. One thing is clear. It typically takes quite some time from the beginning to end of a Commission strategic spectrum reallocation process. But the clock is ticking on our country’s mobile broadband leadership opportunity and our global competitiveness challenge, and we have to get started.\n","Our Plan for mobile broadband will also recommend applying a flexible approach to other frequency bands, where our rules -- technical rules, service rules -- may be holding back the broadband potential of large swaths of spectrum. We need to bring our spectrum policies into the 21st century.\n","The Plan proposes resolving longstanding debates about how to maximize the value of spectrum in bands such as the Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) or Wireless Communications Service (WCS) by giving licensees the option of new flexibility to put the spectrum toward mobile broadband use -- or the option of voluntarily transferring the license to someone else who will. Vital elements of the Commission’s charter are to ensure that, in exercising our responsibilities with respect to spectrum, we promote competition and ensure that spectrum use is in the public interest, and of course all spectrum policy decisions will be made with that in mind.\n","In addition, our National Broadband Plan will encourage innovative ways of using of spectrum, including what some call “opportunistic” uses, to encourage the development of new technologies and new spectrum policy models. Unlicensed spectrum, for example, has been a proven testbed for emerging competition, injecting new investment and innovation into the marketplace, and spawning new services and devices from Bluetooth to WiFi technology. The market for WiFi network equipment alone is about $4 billion a year, and analysts project the market for WiFi-enabled health products will reach $5 billion by 2014. This is what people used to call the “junk band” until the FCC released it for unlicensed use and innovators got to work.\n","In addition, new ideas such as databases that dynamically enable -- or revoke -- access to spectrum in particular times and places promise to change the way we think about spectrum. For example, entrepreneurs could create new types of devices and ad hoc networks, enabling innovative new uses of spectrum. And, spurred by the smart persistence of my colleague Commissioner Michael Copps, the Plan will include a recommendation that we invest a sufficient amount in R&D to ensure that the science underpinning spectrum use continues to advance.\n","To close the adoption gap, our Plan would propose the creation of a Mobility Fund, as part of broader reforms of the Universal Service Fund. Without increasing the overall size of universal service funding, the Plan will seek to provide one-time support for deployment of infrastructure enabling robust mobile broadband networks, to bring all states to a minimum level of mobile availability. Bringing all states up to a national standard will help enable Americans in unserved areas participate in the mobile revolution.\n","Finally, and critically, to improve mobile communications for our first responders, we will develop the 700 MHz public safety broadband network to achieve long overdue interoperability. I will have more to say on public safety tomorrow, but let me just mention now that we will have a comprehensive public safety strategy in the National Broadband Plan. At a high level, our goals will be achieved through public-private partnerships between public safety and 700 MHz commercial providers, including, but not limited to, a commercial licensee of the “D block.” The plan will also recommend that we establish and fund an Emergency Response Interoperability Center (ERIC) within the FCC to develop common technical standards for interoperability on the public safety broadband network from the start, and to update these standards periodically as broadband technology evolves.\n","These are all programs in an ambitious Plan to deliver the benefits of broadband service, both wireless and wired, to all Americans and to invest in and build a world-leading broadband infrastructure in the U.S. There is an enormous amount of work to be done. The National Broadband Plan will chart a clear path forward. And if we do not seize the moment, I fear for the opportunity we will have lost.\n","I’d like to close with one last comparison to the Olympics. The Olympics are unique in sport because they only come every four years. When you get your chance, you better make it count, because you don’t know when, or if, you’ll get another shot. With this Plan, we have a special opportunity to lay a foundation for American leadership in the 21st century.\n","If we get it right, broadband will be an enduring engine for creating jobs and growing our economy, for spreading knowledge and enhancing civic engagement, for advancing a healthier, sustainable way of life. This is our moment. Let’s seize it. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the national Broadband Plan will be the culmination of a tremendous amount of hard work and effort. many studies have the U.S. ranked outside the top 10 when it comes to broadband penetration and speed, but few would suggest that we are leading the world in broadband, or are even as close as we should be. --------------------------\n","665 \n","Original text: We know you highly esteem the kind of learning taught in these colleges. And the maintenance of our young men, while with you, would very expensive to you. We're convinced, therefore, that you mean to do us good by your proposal, and we thank you heartily. But you who are so wise must know that different nations have different conceptions of things. And you will not, therefore, take it amiss if our ideas of this kind of education happens not to be the same with yours.\n","We have had some experience of it. Several of our young people were formerly brought up in the colleges of the northern province. They were instructed in all your sciences. But when they came back to us, they were bad runners, ignorant of every means of living in the woods, unable to bear either cold or hunger, knew neither how to build a cabin, take a deer, or kill an enemy, spoke our language imperfectly, and therefore were neither fit for hunters, warriors, nor councilors. They were totally good for nothing.\n","We are, however, not the less obliged for your kind offer, though we decline accepting. To show our grateful sense of it, if the gentlemen of Virginia shall send us a dozen of their sons, we would take great care in their education, instruct them in all we know, and make men of them. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," we're convinced that you mean to do us good by your proposal, and we thank you heartily. many of our young people were formerly brought up in the colleges of the northern province, a province that has different conceptions of things. we are not the less obliged for your kind offer, though we decline accepting. to show our grateful sense of it, we would take great care in their education, instruct them in all we know. --------------------------\n","666 \n","Original text: Well, can I thank you for reminding us about British involvement in this area?\n","I would like to start, I think, with an area where I hope, I believe, there is common agreement in this room and in our respective capitols -- which is the nature of the threat that we are trying to deal with here. I've listened to most of the discussion today and, to some extent, I have to say we haven't really just reminded ourselves about one or two very important features of this campaign that we are trying to address.\n","International violent jihadism, I do not believe, is and will prove to be, susceptible to any rational political accommodation. It does present an existential threat to our way of life, and we must acknowledge that. It may not threaten our borders in the way that previous security challenges that we've had to face do, but I believe it to be just as important a threat to our way of life as previous security challenges we've confronted. And finally, I just do think it worth just reminding ourselves -- because we tend to gather on these circumstances and chuck around quite a lot of blame -- this is not a confrontation we sought, but it is a confrontation that we have to win.\n","I want, secondly, to say one or two words now about the mission itself and what I see as the implications for all of us of what we're doing in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Firstly, my comment is this: These sorts of operations are not an aberration. The last 10 years, I think, have not been and shouldn't be seen as exceptional. These are the nature of future security operations that all of us are likely to be involved in, to greater or to a lesser extent. So this is the pattern of future conflict. NATO, its allies and friends around the world -- we have to prepare for this type of conflict for the future. Even if we are successful in Afghanistan in the near future, this is not the end of this campaign. We must prepare for it.\n","I do not believe that we are properly preparing for it.\n","Specifically, I think in the future we will need much more of a seamless connection between our armed forces, our police and intelligence and security agencies. And above all, those agencies must themselves be capable of delivering greater civil effect, because in many of these scenarios, many of these contexts, it is only our men and women in uniform who are likely to be able to deliver on the ground in very difficult security circumstances the civil effect that we all know is important to support these operations.\n","And here I agree very, very strongly with what Secretary Gates said very recently. He said, our armed forces in the future must have not just the ability when the need arises to knock the door down, but then to clean up the mess and start rebuilding. That is, I think, a challenge for all Defense Ministers in this room.\n","I think the strategy, therefore -- we've had a lot of talk today about the strategy -- I think we've got the right strategy, which is to improve security and improve political institutions so they can better repel jihadist terrorism, while specifically we build up Afghan security capabilities and recognize the regional dimension to the threat that we are trying to deal with.\n","So, my approach to this is not to say that we don't have the strategy, we don't have the right strategy -- we do. It's a focus on how that strategy is being delivered. I think the real issue for us today -- all of us -- is whether we believe today we have assembled the right resources to execute the strategy that we've chosen to deliver, both political and military. And my view is that we don't.\n","Given where we are today, however, I think we need stronger force levels in Afghanistan, so that the ground that needs to be cleared can be cleared and then held and built upon -- and ultimately transferred to the authority of Afghan security forces. We certainly need better governance at every level in Afghanistan, both regional and national. And we need the collective political will -- all of us -- to make that improvement in governance happen.\n","I don't think we face a choice between greater security on the one hand and political progress on the other. I hear that debate sometimes. I think that's wrong. We need both. We need greater security right now in order to improve the success of any political reconciliation process. Always better, I think, to cut a long argument short and say we should negotiate from strength, not weakness. You get a better prospect of success that way.\n","I think the extra U.S. forces are going to make a difference, a positive difference. What I think is less developed at the moment is the practical support that we need to see demonstrated for political reconstruction. Again, my analysis would be we've been long on rhetoric, painfully short on delivery.\n","On burden sharing, an issue that needs to be raised, I think, in this forum, my view is that we need to do more on every level to support the leadership that the United States is showing. The Afghan government in turn needs to make more progress in dealing with the problem of corruption and drugs, which we know is a toxic poison affecting the strategy and its successful delivery. And I believe we are entitled to ask for better progress in those areas because we cannot ask our soldiers to lay down their lives for anything less.\n","And my final point I want to say about -- The final point I want to say is about NATO, because I think we face a moment of choice here as well. I'm frustrated. I think probably all of us are. We're fighting, I think, a[n] existential campaign in Afghanistan, and potentially in other regions. What I want from NATO is more of a wartime mentality to rise to the challenge of the threat that we face -- less of a peacetime culture which is characterized, I'm afraid, far too often by process, an obsession with process, bureaucracy, and prevarication. This is a fundamental struggle that we are facing. We'd better recognize that and deal with it appropriately.\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john avlon: can you thank you for reminding us about British involvement in this area? he says we haven't really just reminded ourselves about one or two very important features of this campaign. we must acknowledge that international violent jihadism does present an existential threat to our way of life, and it does not threaten our borders in the way that previous security challenges we've faced do. --------------------------\n","667 \n","Original text: On the train, Truman showed Churchill a recent re-design of the presidential seal. The eagle’s head was turned to the right, so it faced the talons holding olive branches. Now, that represented diplomacy. But rather than having the eagle turn to face the arrows, which represented war, Churchill pondered for a moment and he said, “I think the head should be on a swivel, back and forth.” In other words: Diplomacy and military strength go hand in hand. They are indeed intimately related. Each relies on the other. I saw this as a young Army captain way back in the 1980s, when I patrolled that very Iron Curtain that Churchill spoke about. I had the incredible privilege, along with my fellow soldiers, we were there to deter the Soviets and indeed prepare this country for the worst. But ultimately, it wasn’t our tanks that delivered that victory. It was diplomacy, backed by the credible threat of force that we had projected. Aggies have a long history in the military. But you also have a long history serving America’s diplomatic mission at the State Department, and I’d love that to continue. If you join us, if you work, it will make a difference in the life of every American. Now, I’m going to speak just for a couple more minutes because I want plenty of time to take your questions. But before I do, I want to talk briefly about three aspects of my life, of the State Department’s work. First, it’s an incredible element of promoting national security. As they did during the Cold War, diplomats build relationships to ensure that disagreements never boil over into military conflict. Take Jerica, you just heard from, and her team. They’re talking to Mexican authorities to alleviate migrant crisis and to secure our border. Her colleagues are confronting the opioid crisis by encouraging partners to cut off the drug flows, that fentanyl that comes in the United States and wreaks so much destruction. Just a few months ago, we saw the announcement that China made that they would do their part to deny fentanyl access to our country. It was State Department’s diplomats who sealed that deal. And farther from home, State has helped grow the ranks of the Defeat-ISIS coalition, an enormous victory. We’ve seized back 100 percent of the caliphate, liberating millions of Syrians. American diplomats were at the center of creating that coalition and reducing threats to our citizens. Just this morning, I spoke with our ambassador, who is working to bring peace in Afghanistan. There’s another graduate of this fine institution, a young lady named Melissa. She is supporting our work there to broker peace between the Taliban and the Afghan Government. We’re trying to end the longest war in United States history and save the lives of Afghans and American soldiers alike. Or take a man named Steve Biegun, a truly remarkable fellow. He’s one of my special reps. He’s working on the North Korea file. His team has gotten an international coalition together to put the toughest sanctions in history on Chairman Kim Jong-un and his country. But Steve’s work is also important in that we are keeping the door open, working to achieve a diplomatic outcome where North Korea will be denuclearized in a way that brings peace to the peninsula. Steve and our team have gotten enormous results. I was privileged to be in North Korea where Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song, and Tony Kim were able to climb on an American airplane and return home from their -- to their families from being held hostage in that country, a remarkable diplomatic achievement. Indeed, I’ll never forget the moment, the very moment when they met their families on the tarmac. President Trump was there to greet them too, and I was thinking that morning -- it was 3:00 a.m. Washington D.C. time -- about the amazing work that our team had done not just that day, but in the weeks and months before that. Absent that great work, absent the work of people like you who decided to join the Department of State, they might well still be held in the hands of the North Koreans. The second thing we do every day at the State Department people don’t truly see directly: We make sure that our diplomacy impacts the American people by strengthening the United States economy. The truth is we have to compete in a global economy. The United States businesses need access to markets all across the world. President Trump is determined to open those markets for our products. That’s certainly true of companies and businesses here in Texas where exports benefit your economy to the tune of $260 billion a year. It supports more than 900,000 Texas jobs. And we help. We help by supporting these economic opportunities through our diplomats. We work to open these markets where there are some 1,600 economic officers stationed all across the world. We try to take down barriers. We try to make the case for American companies and why they can deliver true value to nations all across the world. Indeed, it’s the case that there is seldom an engagement -- I was in South America just before coming here today. Not a single one of my conversations -- not in Chile, not in Peru or Paraguay or in Colombia did we miss the opportunity to make sure they understood that America was there prepared to help create value for their countries as well. You’ve seen it in the work we’ve done to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you should know it’s more than just commerce. There’s a strategic element to this too. In Houston last month, I spoke to a group to talk about how energy impacts each and every one of us, how there is a national security component to America’s capacity to deliver energy all around the world. We watch as a pipeline is being built in Europe, which will tether Germany to Russia in a way that is not good for German security or the security of the United States of America. The work that’s being done here in Texas and Kansas and Oklahoma, all of the energy fields and in North Dakota -- if done well, can work with our diplomacy to deliver true security not only to America, but to Europe as well. And you should know Aggies are also helping State create a program to transport excess natural gas from right here in Texas to the Dominican Republic, so it can be sold throughout the Caribbean. We want to make sure the lights are on for your next spring break. We’ve got another team, a team that’s working to warn our friends and partners against buying Chinese 5G technology and build out their infrastructure with Chinese equipment. These are companies like Huawei, which will take your private information and transfer it to the Chinese Government. It makes no sense. And American diplomats are at the forefront of sharing this information with the world. None of us want our privacy, our freedom falling into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. The final thing before I close: The State Department helps with our American diplomats promoting and protecting our values -- indeed, our very way of life. The U.S. is the global standard-bearer for democracy, for freedom, for liberty, and for human rights as well. If we don’t speak up, no one else will. A few months back, the United States made the decision to leave the United Nations Human Rights Council. We did so because it had become under the control of authoritarians and dictators, people that didn’t really care about human rights. We made the decision to move our embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing facts on the ground. And our diplomats are even, as we speak, all across the world promoting American values and human rights all across the globe. We’re working on various missions, including making sure that the nature of Chinese Orwellian systems, particularly their clampdown on people of faith, are impacting us right here at home. I recently had the privilege to meet with a group of Uighur Muslims that came to my office. They talked about the systemic imprisonment, they talked about oppression, and even torture happening in parts of China today. This cannot be allowed to stand. We’re exerting maximum pressure to change the very nature of the Islamic Republic of Iran to make sure that that regime simply behaves like a normal country and does not spread terror throughout the world. Today as we stand here, Iran is engaged in conducting an assassination campaign throughout Europe. Our diplomats are working to push back against them so this will stop. And my most recent trip was part of the effort that’s being led by the Organization of American States and the Lima Group as we work to restore human rights and democracy in Venezuela. I know that we will ultimately be successful and that Mr. Maduro will leave that country. Our diplomats also go on offense to promote American values, in part simply by building and maintaining a set of relationships that are centrally important to our country. These deep friendships matter as time moves on. Jerica mentioned some of the work that she does with the youth in Ciudad Juarez. That’s a long-term investment in our relationship with our partners to the south in Mexico. We trust that the young people that she’s working with will come to understand America, that they will come to understand how much we care about them. And when it’s their time to lead, they will become good partners for our great nation. We do something different on a truly national scale as well with foreign aid. We provide assistance to countries like no other country in the world. Our goal is often to turn struggling nations into strong, long-term partners, democratic partners for the United States. And in times of crisis, when we’ve offered a hand, I can tell you that people like Melissa, the former Aggie stationed there in Afghanistan today, will benefit from the American aid which we’ve provided to that country. About four years ago Melissa was in a tour in Nepal when a devastating earthquake hit that country, killing nearly 9,000 people. She said it was one of her proudest moments as an American diplomat. She watched as the embassy rallied to the people’s side, allowing those in need to come seek services at our embassy, to shower and to seek food and shelter at the American embassy. For her next tour, she went to Kabul. And just moments after she landed, another earthquake. Everyone in the airport thought it was an explosion, but she knew. She’d been through this before. She next traveled to Mexico City. The year was 2017. You’ll all remember it was one of the most devastating earthquakes to hit the Mexican -- Mexico City in decades. And Melissa saw the great work that the embassy did to make sure that the people of Mexico City got back on their feet. I made sure that Melissa did not come to visit with us today.\n","She will tell you that as a diplomat, there was nothing more rewarding than watching American excellence, American graciousness, American resources in power, to meet and help people in times of adversity. This is the life of an American diplomat, and a noble undertaking, and one of true public service. There is a story. It’s about President Reagan’s secretary of state, Secretary George Shultz. He understood diplomacy. He would meet with our ambassadors as they went to the field. He would ask every ambassador who came by his office just before they went out for their first assignment -- he would give them a pop quiz. He would take them over to the side of his room, he would point them to a globe, and he would ask them -- he would say, “Now that you’ve been confirmed by the Senate, point to the country that you now represent.” And they’d all fail, because they’d point to the country which they were leaving. Indeed, the correct place to point for every one of our diplomats is their service to the United States of America. Secretary of State Shultz knew that, President Reagan knows that, President Trump and I know that too. I know that you all have a tremendous sense of duty, a tremendous sense of service. I hope that today you can see that America’s State Department is committed to living up to those standards. And if our mission appeals to you after your time serving elsewhere, we would love to have you come be part of our team. Thank you all for letting me be here today. Thank you for allowing me to be with you. Good luck, God bless you, and I look forward to taking your questions. Thank you.\n","Mr. Petroff: Well, welcome to Aggieland. Secretary Pompeo: It’s great to be here. Mr. Petroff: I wanted to start first by asking about -- if there are some young people in the crowd that really did hear that call to serve, what are the steps they should take in order to join the State Department and make a difference in the world? Secretary Pompeo: Talk to the team standing right in the back on your way out. We’ll sign you up. So there’s lots of different ways to serve at the State Department. We have folks from all different backgrounds -- engineers, event planners, speechwriting teams, all the skills that the Lord gives different people. You can go take a look on our website, and then for those who want to make a career working in the Foreign Service, study hard and prepare for the Foreign Service exam, and then the process is pretty straightforward from there. Mr. Petroff: Okay, great. As we sort of look towards the future, what does -- how does the State Department meet the technological challenges that the 21st century presents? Secretary Pompeo: So there’s two things as we look forward that I think are absolutely paramount. As Jerica said, I’m now two weeks short of being Secretary of State for one full year. There’s two things, as I stare at the State Department to make sure that we’re ready for the 21st century. One of them is what you identified. We need the capacity to move at the speed of our adversaries. They move quickly. Whether that’s al-Qaida or ISIS or the Russians or the Cubans, they make decisions quickly. They -- none of those are democracies, with all the process that’s attached to that. And I wouldn’t trade it for the world, don’t make -- don’t confuse. But we have to make sure that American diplomacy can move at that speed. There’s an information component to that, there’s a technology component to that, and there’s places that we have real work to do. The second thing we need -- and by the way, that space, that information management space, we saw this with the Russian efforts to impact our elections. We see this in the information space in Iran today. That information space is an incredibly important component of being able to deliver the American message around the world in ways that it wasn’t 20 or 30 years ago. The capacity for cheap, simple information readily available on your handset is different and presents a different information challenge for us. And we need to make sure that we’re sitting there right on people’s handset sharing the American message in the same way that our adversaries want to share in those countries as well. The second piece is cultural, inside an institution. I have run a tank platoon. I was an executive officer in a cavalry troop. I ran two small businesses then was the director of the CIA, and now I am running the State Department. Every organization has to have an ethos, a central mission set that is clearly understood so that every single officer of the State Department understands the commander’s intent. And so we’re working to build out life-cycle training programs and making sure that the ethos of the 21st century diplomat, the commitments that I spoke about in my remarks, are at the forefront of every officer’s mind. So when you get to a place and you get to a time when there is a decision to be made, and perhaps the guidance isn’t detailed sufficiently, you’ll have the principles, you’ll have the core understanding of what it is the expectations are for American diplomats, and you’ll make a really good decision. I’m confident that we’re in a good place there, but there’s always more that can be done. Mr. Petroff: Great. Our campus is so excited to welcome you here today, and in the leadup to today we gave the community the opportunity to submit some questions. And Wiley has gathered some of those great submissions, and so now I’d like to turn to our audience for some more questions. Can you please stand? Question: Howdy. Secretary Pompeo: Hi. Howdy. Get it right. I got it.\n","Question: Good job. Good job. Secretary Pompeo: I’m from Kansas. I can --. Question: So my name is Riley Ferrell [ph]. I’m a sophomore here, and I have a question for you. Here at Texas A&M we have a very strong tie to the military, which is very similar to your alum, West Point. How has this exposure to military culture when you were younger shaped your perceptions of diplomacy? Secretary Pompeo: Yeah, that is a fantastic question. You do have that same culture here for sure. Throughout the whole institution, the commitment to duty and service permeates this institution in the same way it did the place that I did my undergraduate time. I will tell you the other thing that I really took away from my time as a young officer in the military that I think is of enormous value in my current role, and I ask all of our diplomats to do this, which is to listen. I remember -- I’ve told this story before -- there’s an E7 named Sgt. 1st Class Petry, who, when I was a young second lieutenant, I went to my first assignment. I got out of what was an MI51 Jeep. Very few of you would remember these. And I climbed out and I walked over to him, and I had my gold bar and I’d been commissioned for all of, I don’t know, 90 days or 120 days. And I walked up to Sgt. Petry, and he saluted and said, “Young man, you’ll do well if you just shut up for a while.” He was right. I was also afraid of him, so it all worked.\n","The capacity to understand, the capacity to listen in the military, is critical -- to listen to your soldiers to make sure you understand, to listen to your commanders so you understand exactly what it is they’re trying to get at -- the same thing as here. I spend a great deal of my time talking and engaged with my counterparts around the world. I was with Chilean President Pinera a few days back, right? I wanted to not only hear him, to hear what he’d said, the things he had on his mind, but to listen in a way to try and comprehend what it was he really wanted and how our two countries could work best together. If you said what’s the one thing that I remember from my time in service, I learned a lot about leadership, but one of the things I truly did come to appreciate was the value of listening and taking onboard the ideas of others so that you can execute the mission more effectively. I hope all of the folks who work here at the State Department take that lesson onboard as well. Thank you. Question: Thank you so much for your answer and for joining us here in Aggieland. Secretary Pompeo: Thank you, Riley. Question: Hi, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for the opportunity. My name is Angelita Garcia [ph]. I am a third-year Ph.D. student. My question to you is: How does the State Department handle time-sensitive issues such as the humanitarian crisis currently gripping Venezuela? Thank you. Secretary Pompeo: So you have a big government, and that means sometimes we don’t move just as fast as we need to. The great news is, is when a crisis breaks, we’re good, we’re very effective. So we have a group that is called the USAID. They provide aid and assistance, usually medicine and food. And literally within a handful of days of the recognition that the crisis, the humanitarian element of the crisis in Venezuela, had spiraled, it had spiked -- it had been difficult; this has been years in the making, but it had taken a step change in the wrong direction -- we were able to move not only food and medicine, but water. We were able to mobilize airlift from our military, C-17s flying to -- I flew in here from Cucuta, Colombia, to take it to the border. The American people are enormously generous. It’s still sitting. I walked through the warehouse, where there is still food and medicine sitting. We can’t always get it -- as in the case of Venezuela, we weren’t able to get it to the people who needed it. Maduro is still denying food to the starving and medicine to sick children. I saw some of those sick children yesterday who had crossed the border into Colombia. It’s truly tragic. But you should know the State Department in a crisis, and those crises can range from humanitarian crisis to -- I recall very early in President Trump’s term -- I was not in this job, I was the director of the CIA at the time -- when Bashar Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people. Your government was able to, in the course of a very eventful 36 hours, do all the groundwork that was needed to make sure that we could respond, to let them -- the leader there in Syria understand that this was unacceptable and this administration wasn’t going to allow the use of chemical weapons -- Assad to use chemical weapons against his own people. We moved quickly, we moved accurately. The Department of Defense did its task flawlessly. It was a demonstration of American capacity to move in crisis moments in a way that is very effective. Question: Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here today. I am a Dreamer. What would you tell the Dreamers in this country who have love for this country, who attended these universities like I have, and who fear this administration? Secretary Pompeo: Yeah. So -- Question: And thank you for being here. Secretary Pompeo: Thank you very much, sir. Look, this administration has been clear: There was a -- there was work that was done early on in the administration, try to achieve comprehensive immigration reform which would have impacted many. I don’t know your particular situation, but would have impacted many. Couldn’t make the political machine work. It is also the case that President Trump is determined. He is determined to ensure that there’s American sovereignty on our southern border and that we know who’s coming in and out of our country. That seems like a -- there seems to be widespread agreement -- I served in Congress for six years, so I suppose you could say I’m part of the problem too, but suffice it to say I think there’s consensus there, and yet we can’t get our laws tweaked in a way that I think would fundamentally recognize the central values of America in a way that would do honor to all those who want to come here and want to come here in a way that is lawful and those that are trying to come here legal, which is something President Trump has made clear. And I think there’s consensus on both sides of the aisle, frankly, that that’s something that we need to be capable of stopping as well, so -- Question: Excuse me, Mr. Secretary. I’m 100 percent disabled veteran, and she is -- the lady here -- she’s active Army. And due to my service to the country and her service to the country -- I [inaudible] -- that we are not able to go to see our family, as you know better than everyone in this room. And I just need my family. I have not seen my mother-in-law, my brother-in-law for seven years. And your subordinate in Embassy Dubai -- they denied the case, although we dealt -- we told them we just need to see them for 12 days to show them the country and see me. And -- but they denied the case. And I served the country, I -- disabled 100 percent. After [inaudible], I lost 25 friends just in my last deployment, but no one taking care of my kids. And I told them they’re not going to be staying here as an immigrant, they just want to come here to see me, to see my home, and that’s all I need, for just 10 days. And they did even not listen to me, sir. Okay, thank you. Secretary Pompeo: Yeah, thank you. Thank you for your service. I can’t comment. I don’t know your particular case, so I just can’t -- I apologize. I can’t answer your question about that particular situation. Mr. Petroff: If we could please hold questions to those with the mike, please.\n","Question: He is the state representative. Question: Mr. Secretary, with the new designation of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a foreign terrorist organization, I was wondering how heavily the United States would be pursuing sanctions against companies with alleged dealings with this organization. Secretary Pompeo: Vigorously. So I’ll -- so we never talk about sanctions, any particular sanction before we get to the place where we can make a decision, but this was -- if you back up a step -- it’s -- you have to back up a step. Our mission is to try and create peace and stability in the Middle East. That’s the macro objective. And so we’ve worked on that by building out an enormous coalition to defeat ISIS. We’re still working to take down the remnants of ISIS. There are various estimates, from 5 to 12 to 21,000 members of ISIS who are still there, moving around in Iraq and Syria and Turkey. Our efforts to continue to prevent them from attacking around the globe are real and serious and will continue. The second piece of that has been to identify the other great threat, which is the Islamic Republic of Iran, which remains the largest sponsor of terror, who has supported Lebanese Hezbollah, has supported Hezbollah's actions in Syria. The Shia militias under the stranglehold of the ayatollah who are working in Iraq aren’t working for the best interests of the Iraqi people. You see what’s happened in Yemen -- an enormous -- an enormous humanitarian crisis. The UN did good work in Stockholm to reach an agreement, but the Iranians won’t let the Houthis actually implement the Stockholm agreement. So the second piece of this is to convince Iran it’s not in their best interest to continue to foment terror and engage in malign activity all throughout the Middle East. So a -- so the next step down from that is how do you do it. One of the pieces of that is our sanctions effort. We have lots of efforts apart from that. With respect to the designation, which actually came into effect just this week, some -- the unclassified -- some 20 percent of the Iraqi economy is controlled by the IRGC. So my wisdom for those of you who are connected to companies that might be doing business with them or if you’re the general counsel for a European bank that’s doing business with a company that might have a 20 percent shareholder, the IRGC, is you should check your work. Question: Howdy, Mr. Secretary. My question for you is: Given your experience as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, can you elaborate on the intersection between U.S. intelligence operations and U.S. diplomatic operations, as well as how the two cooperate or clash? Secretary Pompeo: Yes, ma’am, I can. Howdy to you. So it’s amazing -- I’m the only person ever in American history to hold both of those jobs consecutively. We’ll find out if that’s a good idea or a bad idea. The history books will get to write that.\n","It was fascinating. It was great preparation, because I had a couple of advantages coming into this job. I had had a chance to work on almost every one of these same problem sets from a different optic in this administration, so it gave me a good jumpstart when I came to be Secretary of State. The two institutions have very different mission sets. The CIA’s mission set is clean and simple: deliver the best data set to the most important leader in the world and deliver it in a timely fashion and a consumable fashion. So as CIA director, you spend every moment worried that you didn’t get the president of the United States or the secretary of state or the secretary of defense the information they needed to make a really world-class decision in a tough space. So that’s the CIA mission. It doesn’t come into conflict with the Department of State all that often. Indeed, I spoke with Director [Gina] Haspel just this morning. I had a handful of questions about a particular problem set I was working on. I asked her to go make sure that tomorrow when I have the opportunity, I get a chance to see their latest and best information set. So they will be providing a tool for us. Done well, the Intelligence Community -- more broadly than just the CIA, there are many other elements, we have folks that do lots of other pieces of intelligence collection -- the Intelligence Community will provide that fundamental underpinning. I talked about the Syria chemical strike. The first in the barrel to respond to that was the CIA. The President wanted to know immediately were they really chemical weapons that were fired or was this -- right? We’ve all seen YouTube videos that turned out not to be true. Were the chemical weapons actually fired by the regime? Did they actually hit civilians? What was the magnitude, what was the scope, what was the nature of those chemical weapon systems? Before he could make a decision or even consider a recommendation by his secretary of state about how to respond, he needed to have best-in-class data. And we were under the gun. The CIA, the Intelligence Community doesn’t get things right every time. It has a history; it’s made mistakes; it’s imperfect like the rest of us. So we were under the gun. The President gave us just a handful of hours, and we deployed an amazing team -- a team of chemists and physicists and engineers and battlefield experts and explosive device experts and folks who spend their whole life looking at potholes in the road to decide what it was that actually created that crater. It’s a great life. It took us a few more hours than I wished, but in a matter of hours I was able to deliver a very clear response to the President, identify places that were risks, what we knew, what we didn’t know, but it gave him sufficient information that he could then move on to look for the then-secretary of state to give him a recommendation about the foreign policy that we ought to pursue there, and then in this case he turned to the Department of Defense to consider potential responses as well. It was a place where you see a perfect example of America’s military and diplomacy and intelligence all working together to deliver to the President of the United States a clean set of options based on real data. Question: Thank you, sir. Secretary Pompeo: Thank you, ma’am. Question: Howdy, Mr. Secretary. Secretary Pompeo: Howdy. Question: My name is Sanjay Letchuman [ph], and I was wondering, in the light of recent diplomatic efforts abroad with nations such as North Korea and Syria, which you talked about a little bit, do you see sanctions being lifted off these nations in the foreseeable future? Secretary Pompeo: Sanjay [ph], I hope so. I would love nothing more than to lift the sanctions on North Korea, I truly would, because it would mean we were successful. It would mean that North Korea no longer had a nuclear weapons program or a weapons of mass destruction program. It would mean we’d had the opportunity to verify that that was the case, so we knew we weren’t taking anyone’s word for that. It would be a glorious thing. President Trump talks frequently and tweets almost as often about a brighter future for North Korea, right? We desperately want that. Steve Biegun -- I mean, the work that he’s done and our team has done -- we have -- it’s remarkable. We have the toughest sanctions in history on North Korea today. And frankly, the work that’s been done at the United Nations -- they’re not American sanctions. These are UN Security Council resolutions. These are the world’s sanctions on North Korea. They’re the toughest in history, and yet we have also made more progress on negotiating the leader of North Korea to make a strategic shift, to make this decision that says, no, it’s the -- these -- the history which said that a nuclear weapon system is the only defense, it’s our only lever for security, to make the shift to say no, that’s actually what threatens our nation the most. We haven’t gotten there. Chairman Kim signed a document in Singapore in June. He’s told me no fewer than half a dozen times that he is prepared to denuclearize. I’ve now spent more time with Chairman Kim than Dennis Rodman. I’m very proud of that. We’re not home yet, but I pray that one day that President Trump gets to announce that we’re removing the sanctions regime from North Korea. Syria -- I put Syria in the same bucket. There are those who think that Assad has prevailed. I don’t know that there’s a need to declare winners and losers, but the facts on the ground are that today Assad rules over a very broken country with 6 million displaced persons. He controls, depending on how you count it, a third to 40 percent of the real estate of Syria. Much of the oil wealth, the thing that has driven Syria’s economy for an awfully long time, is not in the control of the Assad regime, and he faces a determined coalition put together in part by the institution that I am so privileged to run, whether they are European countries or Gulf state nations or countries even in Africa who recognize that we can’t begin to rebuild Syria until there is a political resolution there. And so before those sanctions go away, before not only the UN sanctions but the American sanctions, the sanctions that the European Union has put in place go away, UN Security Council Resolution 2254 will have to have been fulfilled, which means a political resolution to the outcome, so the migrants who have left Syria for Turkey and for Lebanon and for Jordan can return home and a political process can begin to move forward. These sanctions are never something we do with glee, and we do them only as a means to try and achieve an outcome that’s good for the United States and good for the world. Question: Thank you so much. Secretary Pompeo: Thank you, Sanjay [ph]. Question: Mr. Secretary. Secretary Pompeo: Yes, sir. Question: My name is Oren Shed [ph] and I am a freshman at A&M, and it’s an honor to have you here. My question is: What are some important parts of the State Department’s work that many people are unaware of? Secretary Pompeo: I talked about the economic work we do. You cannot have an effective national security policy without an economy that is growing. We should all be mindful that America remains $22 trillion in debt. That is a challenge. For those of you who -- my son is 28 years old. I figure we’ll pay the bills while I’m here. I wonder if we will for his whole life. You have to have an economy that is thriving and flourishing, and the State Department takes this mission on. There is no other American institution that has officers in the field at nearly every American embassy -- 180-plus American embassies -- where we have economic officers who, for those of you who go decide to start your own business or run a company or become part of a global operation, touch base with our team. We are unabashed in the Trump administration about making sure that American businesses get every opportunity to go compete. I talked about the aid distribution that we do. I don’t think people often connect up the State Department with the humanitarian assistance work that we do, not only the money but the work that we do to coordinate. It is almost always the case that when you see a catastrophe like you saw in Mozambique now a few weeks ago, it is almost always the case it is a State Department officer from the United States that among -- that are among the first people that the government of that country turns to to begin to coordinate and develop effective responses. We’re incredibly proud of that work. The last thing that I didn’t get a chance to talk about that we do is we run big programs that are cultural exchange programs. You would have students here at Texas A&M who came in from other parts of the world to come and study and be part of America. We also work to make sure that students here in America get a chance to go study in other nations. It is remarkable how often I’ll be meeting with a foreign leader and I find that his English is better than mine. That is often because of a State Department program that gave them the opportunity to come visit, understand the United States of America, and the dividends that that pays to our nation from having invested those resources are really important. So there’s a couple, three thoughts about things the State Department does that don’t make the front page of the local paper. Question: Thank you very much. Secretary Pompeo: Thank you, sir. Question: Howdy, Mr. Secretary. Could you please share more with us about how you see the relationship between the United States and Latin America developing in the areas of trade and immigration? Secretary Pompeo: So our administration is an enormous beneficiary of the changes that have taken place in South America. For those of you who know the history of South America, democracies have been too few and free-market economies have been far too scarce. Today, South America is turning back in the right direction. You see that in Peru, you see that in Chile, you see that in Brazil, you see it in Ecuador, you see it in many, many South American countries where people have recognized that the old model -- call it -- I don’t want to use a pejorative, but these weren’t free-market economies -- but that the old model had failed them and that they need to rejoin the global world and compete and produce product and add value. So on trade I think there’s an enormous opportunity for American businesses to go to these places, to go to South American countries and sell our products. There’s growing middle classes in these countries as well. And they will also continue to deliver product into our country, so they will continue to move up the value chain and deliver goods for American consumers at prices that are affordable. I think that trade opportunity down there is enormous. When those countries become successful, the migration issues become mitigated, right? People want to stay in their own countries. When I was on the -- it’s been -- 36 hours now. I was on the bridge between Colombia and Venezuela. I watched hundreds of people streaming into Colombia. This was on Palm Sunday afternoon. Hundreds of people steaming in there. And I had a chance to talk with a couple of dozen of them. With one exception, they all wanted to return home to their own country. They had family there, they had deep roots there. But they had nothing. There was no economic opportunity for them. Indeed, many of them said that they had stayed in Venezuela longer than they probably should’ve. I met two mothers who had begun to feed their children every other day. That’s breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking. So as -- so the solution to that, there’s now a million-five migrants in Colombia, there are three-quarters of a million migrants in Peru from Venezuela, hundreds of thousands strewn in other countries in South America. The solution to that is creating democracy and opportunity inside of Venezuela. That’s -- the answer to the migration problem which is burdening Peru and Colombia and Chile, and now Ecuador, the solution to that is creating economic opportunity at home so these people can stay in the first instance. Now, some 3 million of a population of roughly 30 million -- 10 percent of the people of Venezuela -- have been forced to flee their country. We need to do two things. First, we need to fix that, allow the Venezuelan people to fix that so that the next 10 percent don’t leave. That’s the estimate for 2019; somewhere between another 2 and 3 million people will have to flee Venezuela because of economic hardship. And then if we do it well and are good enough to do it quickly and begin to rebuild Venezuela, we can get some of the 3 million who have left back home -- back home to their families, back home to their homes, back home to what they know and love so that they can be part of the rebuilding of Venezuela. I see those same opportunities with respect to migration issues all throughout South America and Mexico too. Mr. Petroff: All right, I think we have time for one last question. Question: Hi, Mr. Secretary. My name is Ben Allen [ph], and I’m a civil engineering student. My question for you is: How do you balance condemnations with concessions in diplomacy with a controversial government such as Saudi Arabia? Thank you. Secretary Pompeo: So I always begin with a deep understanding that no secretary of state gets through their first day without recognizing it’s a tough world out there. We don’t appreciate how glorious it is to be here in the United States of America on a consistent enough basis and with enough fervor. Maybe you do here at Texas A&M, but I think too many Americans don’t understand how blessed we are. These are -- are many, many tough places out there. Having said that, not all tough places are the same. They each present a different set of challenges. I -- it reminds me, you would know this as -- it’s a bit of an aside. But in terms of how you think about problem sets, I -- when I was a cadet, what’s the first -- what’s the cadet motto at West Point? You will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do. I was the CIA director. We lied, we cheated, we stole. It’s -- it was like -- we had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment. And so when you deal with these countries, you have to just recognize they’re not all the same. Some of these difficult, nasty places want to partner with the United States and just haven’t gotten to the right place yet, just haven’t been able to move their own institutions. And some of them may only be trying half as much as they ought to be trying, but they’re trying to move in the right direction. That presents a very different way of thinking about how the United States ought to address them. In those cases, we ought to assist them. We should never shy away from calling them out. We have to be consistent. The State Department puts out every year a Human Rights Report. It’s just a compendium of bad acts around the world during the last 12 months. It’s way too long a book. But you should look at it. We call out friends, we call out adversaries, we call out everyone in between. But we have to find places where some of these countries that aren’t living up to our human rights standards -- we address it, we work to fix it, we hold them accountable as best we can, and then we work to make sure those things don’t happen again. There are another set of bad actors who’d just as soon see you all perish from this planet. That calls out for a different American response. And so sorting those through, figuring out exactly the right mix of American tools -- diplomatic tools, economic tools, political tools, military tools, figuring out precisely what the right mix is the task that we engage in at the State Department, but we do it with all of our partners in the national security apparatus as well. So the leadership in the White House, the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, the Department of Treasury -- we were talking about sanctions -- all of those have an important piece of figuring out what exactly the right mix is. And so just two things. One, we need to constantly evaluate if we have that right with respect to every one of those actors. Have we got the right balance? Are they still in the same place? Are they still making progress? Are they still serious about addressing the shortcomings that we identify? And then second, we have to be relentless, whether they are friends or adversaries, in making sure when a nation falls short that America will never shy away from calling them out for that behavior that didn’t rise to the level that we hope every nation can achieve. Mr. Petroff: All right. Well, I think that’s all the time we have today. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Secretary Pompeo: Thank you all very much.\n","Mr. Petroff: It was a pleasure to meet you, sir. Secretary Pompeo: Thank you. I appreciate it.

And I feel great pride in the fact that to the few citizens of other countries who have received this high honor, the name of an African is now added.\n","*If today the people of South Africa are free at last to address their basic needs; if the countries of southern Africa have the opportunity to realize the potential for development through co-operation; if Africa can devote all her energies and resources to her reconstruction; then it is not least because the American people identified with and lent their support to the struggle to end apartheid, including critically through action by this Congress.*\n","It is also because of the actions of countless ordinary American citizens who responded to the call to join the world-wide anti-apartheid campaign, or who have since joined hands with us as we strive to make a living reality of our vision of a better life for all South Africans.\n","Among those we remember today is young Amy Biehl. She made our aspirations her own and lost her life in the turmoil of our transition, as the new South Africa struggled to be born in the dying moments of apartheid. Through her, our peoples have also shared the pain of confronting a terrible past, as we take the path towards the reconciliation and healing of our nation.\n","In all these ways, the United States and its people have played a significant role in the birth of our new nation. Since the achievement of democracy, the relations between our countries have been steadily growing. We appreciate the commitment to our future that was embodied in the decision to set up the Bi-National Commission, and that has informed the Commission's contribution to the systematic development of an all-round relationship between our countries.\n","The highly successful State Visit by President Clinton to South Africa in March this year testified as to the strength of our relationship. The warm welcome he received from our people speaks of the special place that the people of the United States occupy in the hearts of South Africans. The breadth of our relationship makes the United States an indispensable partner in bringing material improvement in the lives of our people -- especially the poor, without which our democracy would remain a hollow shell and our stability fragile.\n","Yet we need to remind ourselves that, as much as we have made progress in changing our peoples' lives for the better, the needs that must be met in our country, our region, and our continent are immense. Though we are long past blaming our past for our problems, it does need to be acknowledged that the imbalances and inequities bequeathed to us by the history of Africa and South Africa, are beyond our capacity to meet on our own. They call for a partnership of Africa and the United States, developing and developed countries, in bringing about a transfer of resources and addressing the imbalances and disparities which have been so dramatically exposed in the turmoil in the world economic system.\n","In the common agenda that we seek to develop with you are such issues as increased aid, the rescheduling of the burden of external debt, improved access to markets for the products of developing countries. It includes also the democratization of the institutions of international governance and the redirection of the world's trade and financial system so that it better reflects the needs of the poor.\n","The recognition that even the most powerful economy in the world is not immune from the consequences of defects in the global economic system, so forcefully articulated recently by your own President, indicates to us that the needs of developing countries, and of Africa in particular, will have an understanding hearing in Washington. It adds to our confidence that the United States will be in the forefront of the supporters of Africa's struggle to bring about her relations.\n","Honorable Members: I do not expect to be granted again the privilege of addressing the elected representatives of the United States of America. I am proudly grateful to have been allowed to do so in the last months of my public life.\n","Though the challenges at the present time for our country, our continent, and the world are greater than those we have already overcome, we face the future with confidence. We do because, despite the difficulties and the tensions that confront us, there is in all of us the capacity to touch one another's hearts across oceans and continents.\n","The award with which you honor me today is an expression of the common humanity that binds us: one person to another, nation to nation, and people of the north to people of the south. I receive [it] with pride as a symbol of partnership for peace, prosperity, and equity, as we enter the new millennium.\n","I thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john avlon: i am conscious that in bestowing the Congressional Gold Medal, you are evoking these bonds between our nations. he says it is in that spirit that I humbly accept the award, aware at the same time of the great honor you do me by using me as the vehicle of an unique distinction confirmed -- conferred by this hallowed institution of American democracy. we remember today is young Amy Biehl, --------------------------\n","669 \n","Original text: Ladies and gentlemen, it has been publicly announced that the White House orders of the Roosevelt administration have declared war on HUEY LONG. The late and lamented, the pampered ex-crown prince, Gen. Hugh S. Johnson, one of those satellites loaned by Wall Street to run the Government, and who, at the end of his control over and dismissal from the NRA, pronounced it \"as dead as a dodo\", this Mr. Johnson was apparently selected to make the lead-off speech in this White House charge begun last Monday night. The Johnson speech was followed by more fuss and fury on behalf of the administration by spellbinders in and out of Congress.\n","In a far-away island, when a queen dies, her first favorite is done the honor to be buried alive with her. The funeral procession of the NRA (another one of these new-deal schisms or isms) is about ready to occur. It is said that General Johnson's speech of Monday night to attack me was delivered on the eve of announcing the publication of his obituary in the Red Book Magazine. Seems then that soon this erstwhile prince of the deranged alphabet makes ready to appear at the funeral of NRA like unto the colored lady in Mississippi who there asserted: \"I is de wife of dese remains.\"\n","I shall undertake to cover my main subject and make answer to these gentlemen in the course of this speech tonight.\n","It will serve no purpose to our distressed people for me to call my opponents more bitter names than they call me. Even were I able, I have not the time to present my side of the argument and match them in billingsgate or profanity.\n","What is this trouble with this administration of Mr. [Franklin D.] Roosevelt, Mr. [Hugh S.] Johnson, Mr. [James A.] Farley,l Mr. [Vincent] Astor, and all their spoilers and spellbinders? They think that HUEY LONG is the cause of all their worry. They go gunning for me. But, am I the cause of their misery? They are like old Davy Crockett, who went out to hunt a possum. He saw in the gleam of the moonlight that a possum in the top of a tree was going from limb to limb. He shot and missed. He saw the possum again. He fired a second time and missed again. Soon he discovered that it was not a possum he saw at all in the top of that tree. It was a louse in his own eyebrow.\n","I do not make this illustration to do discredit to any of these gentlemen. I make it to show how often we imagine we see great trouble being done to us by someone at a distance, when, in reality, all of it may be a fault in our own make-up.\n","The trouble with the Roosevelt administration is that when their schemes and isms have failed, these things I told them not to do and voted not to do, that they think it will help them to light out on those of us who warned them in the beginning that the tangled messes and noble experiments would not work. The Roosevelt administration has had its way for two years. They have been allowed to set up or knock down anything and everybody. There was one difference between [Herbert] Hoover and Roosevelt. Hoover could not get the Congress to carry out the schemes he wanted to try. We managed to lick him on a roll call in the United States Senate time after time. But, different with Mr. Roosevelt. He got his plans through Congress. But on cold analysis they were found to be the same things Hoover tried to pass and failed.\n","The kitchen cabinet that sat in to advise Hoover was not different from the kitchen cabinet which advised Roosevelt. Many of the persons are the same. Many of those in Roosevelt's kitchen cabinet are of the same men or set of men who furnished employees to sit in the kitchen cabinet to advise Hoover.\n","Maybe you see a little change in the man waiting on the tables, but back in the kitchen the same set of cooks are fixing up the victuals for us that cooked up the mess under Hoover.\n","Why, do you think this Roosevelt's plan for plowing up cotton, corn, and wheat; and for pouring milk in the river, and for destroying and burying hogs and cattle by the millions, all while people starve and go naked -- do you think those plans were the original ideas of this Roosevelt administration? If you do, you are wrong. The whole idea of that kind of thing first came from Hoover's administration. Don't you remember when Mr. Hoover proposed to plow up every fourth row of cotton? We laughed him into scorn. President Roosevelt flayed him for proposing such a thing in the speech which he made from the steps of the capitol in Topeka, Kans.\n","And so we beat Mr. Hoover on his plan. But when Mr. Roosevelt started on his plan, it was not to plow up every fourth row of cotton as Hoover tried to do. Roosevelt's plan was to plow up every third row of cotton, just one-twelfth more cotton to be plowed up than Hoover proposed. Roosevelt succeeded in his plan.\n","So it has been that while millions have starved and gone naked; so it has been that while babies have cried and died for milk; so it has been that while people have begged for meat and bread, Mr. Roosevelt's administration has sailed merrily along, plowing under and destroying the things to eat and to wear, with tear-dimmed eyes and hungry souls made to chant for this new deal so that even their starvation dole is not taken away, and meanwhile the food and clothes craved by their bodies and souls go for destruction and ruin. What is it? Is it government? Maybe so. It looks more like St. Vitus dance.\n","Now, since they sallied forth with General Johnson to start the war on me, let us take a look at this NRA that they opened up around here two years ago. They had parades and Fascist signs just as Hitler, and Mussolini. They started the dictatorship here to regiment business and labor much more than anyone did in Germany or Italy. The only difference was in the sign. Italy's sign of the Fascist was a black shirt. Germany's sign of the Fascist was a swastika. So in America they sidetracked the Stars and Stripes, and the sign of the Blue Eagle was used instead.\n","And they proceeded with the NRA. Everything from a peanut stand to a power house had to have a separate book of rules and laws to regulate what they did. If a peanut stand started to parch a sack of goobers for sale, they had to be careful to go through the rule book. One slip and he went to jail. A little fellow w ho pressed a pair of pants went to jail because he charged 5 cents under the price set in the rule book. So they wrote their NRA rule book, codes, laws, etc. They got up over 900 of them. One would be as thick as an unabridged dictionary and as confusing as a study of the stars. It would take 40 lawyers to tell a shoe-shine stand how to operate and be certain he didn't go to jail.\n","Some people came to me for advice, as a lawyer, on how to run business. I took several days and then couldn't understand it myself. The only thing I could tell them was that it couldn't be much worse in jail than it was out of jail with that kind of thing going on in the country, and so to go on and do the best they could.\n","The whole thing of Mr. Roosevelt, as run under General Johnson, became such a national scandal that Roosevelt had to let Johnson slide out as the scapegoat. Let them call for an NRA parade tomorrow and you couldn't get enough people to form a funeral march.\n","It was under this NRA and the other funny alphabetical combinations which followed it that we ran the whole country into a mares nest. The Farleys and Johnsons combed the land with agents, inspectors, supervisors, detectives, secretaries, assistants, etc., all armed with the power to arrest and send to jail whomever they found not living up to some rule in one of these 900 catalogs. One man whose case reached the Supreme Court of the United States was turned loose because they couldn't even find the rule he was supposed to have violated in a search throughout the United States.\n","And now it is with PWA's, CWA's, NRA's, AAA's, J-UG's, G-IN's, and every other flimsy combination that the country finds its affairs and business tangled to where no one can recognize it. More men are now out of work than ever; the debt of the United States has gone up another $10 billion. There is starvation; there is homelessness; there is misery on every hand and corner, but mind you, in the meantime, Mr. Roosevelt has had his way. He is one man that can't blame any of his troubles on HUEY LONG. He has had his way. Down in my part of the country if any man has the measles he blames that on me; but there is one man that can't blame anything on anybody but himself, and that is Mr. Franklin De-La-No Roosevelt.\n","And now, on top of that, they order war on me because nearly 4 years ago I told Hoover's crowd it wouldn't do and because 3 years ago I told Roosevelt and his crowd it wouldn't do. In other words, they are in a rage at HUEY LONG because I have said, \"I told you so.\"\n","I am not overstating the conditions now prevailing in this country. In their own words they have confessed all I now say or ever have said. Mr. Roosevelt and even Mrs. Roosevelt have bewailed the fact that food, clothes, and shelter have not been provided for the people. Even Gen. Hugh S. Johnson said in his speech of Monday night that there are 80 million people in America who are badly hurt or wrecked by this depression. Mr. Harry Hopkins, who runs the relief work, says the dole roll has risen now to 22,375,000 persons, the highest it has ever been. And now, what is there for the Roosevelt crowd to do but to admit the facts and admit further that they are now on their third year, making matters worse instead of better all the time? No one is to blame, except them, for what is going on because they have had their way. And if they couldn't change the thing in over two years, now bogged down worse than ever, how could anyone expect any good of them hereafter? God save us two more years of the disaster we have had under that gang.\n","Now, my friends, when this condition of distress and suffering among so many millions of our people began to develop in the Hoover administration, we knew then what the trouble was and what we would have to do to correct it. I was the first man to say publicly -- but Mr. Roosevelt followed in my tracks a few months later and said the same thing. We said that all of our trouble and woe was due to the fact that too few of our people owned too much of our wealth. We said that in our land, with too much to eat, and too much to wear, and too many houses to live in, too many automobiles to be sold, that the only trouble was that the people suffered in the land of abundance because too few controlled the money and the wealth and too many did not have money with which to buy the things they needed for life and comfort.\n","So I said to the people of the United States in my speeches which I delivered in the United States Senate in the early part of 1932 that the only way by which we could restore our people to reasonable life and comfort was to limit the size of the big man's fortune and guarantee some minimum to the fortune and comfort of the little man's family.\n","I said then, as I have said since, that it was inhuman to have food rotting, cotton and wool going to waste, houses empty, and at the same time to have millions of our people starving, naked, and homeless because they could not buy the things which other men had and for which they had no use whatever. So we convinced Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt that it was necessary that he announce and promise to the American people that in the event he were elected President of the United States he would pull down the size of the big man's fortune and guarantee something to every family -- enough to do away with all poverty and to give employment to those who were able to work and education to the children born into the world.\n","Mr. Roosevelt made those promises; he made them before he was nominated in the Chicago convention. He made them again before he was elected in November, and he went so far as to remake those promises after he was inaugurated President of the United States. And I thought for a day or two after he took the oath as President, that maybe he was going through with his promises. No heart was ever so saddened; no person's ambition was ever so blighted, as was mine when I came to the realization that the President of the United States was not going to undertake what he had said he would do, and what I know to be necessary if the people of America were ever saved from calamity and misery.\n","So now, my friends, I come to that point where I must in a few sentences describe to you just what was the cause of our trouble which became so serious in 1929, and which has been worse ever since. The wealth in the United States was three times as much in 1910 as it was in 1890, and yet the masses of our people owned less in 1910 than they did in 1890. In the year 1916 the condition had become so bad that a committee provided for by the Congress of the United States reported that 2 percent of the people in the United States owned 60 percent of the wealth in the country, and that 65 percent of the people owned less than 5 percent of the wealth. This report showed, however, that there was a middle class -- some 33 percent of the people -- who owned 35 percent of the wealth. This report went on to say that the trouble with the American people at that time was that too much of the wealth was in the hands of too few of the people, and recommended that something be done to correct the evil condition then existing.\n","It was at about the same time that many of our publications began to deplore the fact that so few people owned so much and that so many people owned so little. Among those commenting upon that situation was the Saturday Evening Post, which, in an issue of September 23, 1916, said:\n","Along one statistical line you can figure out a Nation bustling with wealth; along another a bloated plutocracy comprising 1 percent of the population lording it over a starving horde with only a thin margin of merely well-to-do in between.\n","And it was, as the Saturday Evening Post and the committee appointed by Congress said, it was a deplorable thing back in 1916, when it was found that 2 percent of the people owned twice as much as all of the remainder of the people put together, and that 65 percent of all of our people owned practically nothing.\n","But what did we do to correct that condition? Instead of moving to take these big fortunes from the top and spreading them among the suffering people at the bottom, the financial masters of America moved in to take complete charge of the Government for fear our lawmakers might do something along that line.\n","And as a result, 14 years after the report of 1916, the Federal Trade Commission made a study to see how the wealth of this land was distributed, and did they find it still as bad as it was in 1916? They found it worse! They found that 1 percent of the people owned about 59 percent of the wealth, which was almost twice as bad as what was said to be an intolerable condition in 1916, when 2 percent of the people owned 60 percent of the wealth. And as a result of foreclosures, failures, and bankruptcies, which began to happen prior to and in the year of 1929, before the campaign of 1932, and at this late date, it is the estimate of all conservative statisticians that 75 percent of the people in the United States don't own anything, that is, not enough to pay their debts, and that 4 percent of the people, or maybe less than 4 percent of the people, own from 85 to 90 percent of all our wealth in the United States.\n","Remember, in 1916 there was a middle class -- 33 percent of the people -- who owned 35 percent of the wealth. That middle class is practically gone today. It no longer exists. They have dropped into the ranks of the poor. The thriving man of independent business standing is fast fading. The corner grocery store is becoming a thing of the past. Concentrated chain-merchandise and banking systems have laid waste to all middle opportunity. That \"thin margin of merely well-to-do in between\" which the Saturday Evening Post mentioned on September 23, 1916, has dwindled to practically no margin of well-to-do in between. Those suffering on the bottom and the few lords of finance on the top are nearly all that are left.\n","It became apparent that the billionaires and multimillionaires even began to squeeze out the common millionaires, closing in and taking their properties and wrecking their businesses. And so we arrived (and are still there) at the place that in abundant America where we have everything for which a human heart can pray, the hundreds of millions -- or, as General Johnson says, the 80 million -- of our people are crying in misery for the want of the things which they need for life, notwithstanding the fact that the country has had and can have more than the entire human race can consume.\n","The 125 million people of America have seated themselves at the barbecue table to consume the products which have been guaranteed to them by their Lord and Creator. There is provided by the Almighty what it takes for them all to eat; yea, more. There is provided more than what is needed for all to eat. But the financial masters of America have taken off the barbecue table 90 percent of the food placed thereon by God, through the labors of mankind, even before the feast begins, and there is left on that table to be eaten by 125 million people less than should be there for 10 million of them.\n","What has become of the remainder of those things placed on the table by the Lord for the use of us all? They are in the hands of the Morgans, the Rockefellers, the Mellons, the Baruches, the Bakers, the Astors, and the Vanderbilts -- 600 families at the most either possessing or controlling the entire 90 percent of all that is in America. They cannot eat the food, they cannot wear the clothes, so they destroy it. They have it rotted; they plow it up; they pour it into the rivers; they bring destruction through the acts of mankind to let humanity suffer; to let humanity go naked; to let humanity go homeless, so that nothing may occur that will do harm to their vanity and to their greed. Like the dog in the manger, they command a wagon load of hay, which the dog would not allow the cow to eat, though he could not eat it himself.\n","So now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to that plan of mine for which I have been so roundly denounced and condemned by such men as Mr. Farley, Mr. Robinson, and Gen. Hugh S. Johnson, and other spellers and speakers and spoilers of the Roosevelt administration. It is for the redistribution of wealth and for guaranteeing comforts and conveniences to all humanity out of this abundance in our country. I hope none will be horror-stricken when they hear me say that we must limit the size of the big man's fortune in order to guarantee a minimum of fortune, life and comfort to the little man; but, if you are, think first that such is the declaration on which Roosevelt rode into the nomination and election of President. While my urgings are declared by some to be the average of a madman, and by such men as General Johnson as insincere bait of a pied piper, if you will listen to me you will find that it is restating the laws handed down by God to man; you will find that it was the exact provision of the contract and law of the Pilgrim Fathers who landed at Plymouth in 1620.\n","Here's what the Pilgrim Fathers said in the contract with the early settlers in the year 1620. I read you article 5 from that contract:\n","5: That at ye end of ye 7. years, ye capital & profits, viz. the houses, lands, goods, and chattels, be equally divided betwixt ye adventurers, and planters; which done, every man shall be free from other of them of any debt or detriment concerning this adventure.\n","So the Pilgrim Fathers wrote into the covenant to do just exactly what the Bible said to do, that they should have an equal division of the wealth every seven years. I don't go that far; I merely advocate that no man be allowed to become so big that he makes paupers out of a million other people\n","You will find that it is the cornerstone on which nearly every religion since the beginning of man has been founded. You will find that it was urged by Bacon, Milton, and Shakespeare in England, by Socrates, Plato, Theognis, and other wisest of men in Greece, by Pope Pius XI in the Vatican, by the world's greatest inventor, Marconi in Italy, by Daniel Webster, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, William Jennings Bryan, and Theodore Roosevelt in the United States, as well as by nearly all of the thousands of great men whose names are yet mentioned in history.\n","The principle was not only the mainspring of Roosevelt's nomination and election, but in the closing speech of Herbert Hoover at Madison Square Garden in November 1932, even Hoover said:\n","My conception of America is a land where men and women may walk in ordered liberty, where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth, not concentrated in the hands of a few but diffused through the lives of all.\n","And so now I come to give you again that plan, taken from these leaders of all times and from the Bible, for the sponsoring of which I am labeled America's menace, madman, pied piper, and demagogue.\n","I propose:\n","First: That every big fortune shall be cut down immediately by a capital levy tax to where no one will own more than a few million dollars, as a matter of fact, to where no one can very long own a fortune in excess of about three to four millions of dollars. I propose that the surplus of all the big fortunes, above the few millions to any one person at the most, shall go into the United States ownership. How would we get all these surplus fortunes into the United States Treasury? Not hard to do. We would not do it by making everyone sell what he owned; no. We would send everyone a questionnaire. On that he would list the properties he owns, lands and houses, stocks and bonds, factories and patents, and so on. Every man would place his appraisal on his property, which the Government would review and maybe change on some items. On that appraisal the big fortune holder would say out of what property he would retain the few millions allowed to him, the balance to go to the United States. Say Mr. Henry Ford should allow that he owned all the stock of the Ford Motor Co., worth, say, $2 billion; he could claim, say $4 million of the Ford stock, but $1,996,000,000 would go to the United States. Say the Rockefeller fortune was listed at $10 billion in oil stocks, bank stocks, money, and stores. Each Rockefeller could say whether he wanted his limit in either the money, oil, or bank stocks, but about nine billion and eight hundred million would go to the Government. And so, in this way, the Government of the United States would come into the possession of about two-fifths of its wealth, which on normal values would be worth, say, $165 billion.\n","Then we would turn to the inventories of the 25 million families of America. All those who showed properties and money clear of debts that were above $5,000 and up to the limit of a few millions would not be touched. But those showing less than $5,000 to the family free of debt would be added to, so that every family would start life again with homestead possessions of at least a home and the comforts needed for a home, including such things as a radio and an automobile. These things would go to every family as a homestead, not to be sold either for debts or taxes or even by consent of the owner except by the consent of the court or Government, and then only on condition that the court hold it to be spent for the purpose of buying another home and comforts thereof.\n","Such would mean that the $165 billion or more taken from big fortunes would have about $100 billion of it used to provide all with the comforts of home and living. The Government might have to issue warrants for claim and location, or even currency to be retired from such property as was claimed, but all that is a detail not impractical to get these homes into the hands of the people.\n","So America would start again with millionaires, but no multi-millionaires or billionaires; with some poor, but none too poor to be denied the comforts of life. America, however, would still have maybe a $65 billion balance from these big fortunes not yet used to set up the poor people. What would we do with that? Wait a moment. I am coming to that, too.\n","Second: We propose that after homes and comforts of homes have been set up for the families of the country, that we shall turn our attention to the children and the youth of the land, providing first for their education and training. We would not have to worry about the problem of child labor, because the very first thing which we would place in front of every child would be not only a comfortable home during his early years but the opportunity for education and training, not only through the grammar school and the high school but through college and to include vocational and professional training for every child. If necessary, that would include the living cost of that child while he attended college, if one should be too distant for him to live at home and conveniently attend, as would be the case with many of those living in the rural areas.\n","We now have an educational system, and in States like Louisiana -- and it is the best one -- where school books are furnished free to every child and where transportation by bus is given to every student, however far he may live from a grammar or high school; there is a fairly good assurance of education through grammar and high school for the child whose father and mother have enough at home to feed and clothe them. But when it comes to a matter of college education, except in few cases the right to a college education is determined at this day and time by the financial ability of the father and mother to pay for the cost and the expense of a college education. It don't make any difference how brilliant a boy or girl may be, that don't give them the right to a college education in America today.\n","Now, Gen. Hugh Johnson says I am indeed a very smart demagogue, a wise and dangerous menace. But I am one of those who didn't have the opportunity to secure a college education or training. We propose that the right to education and the extent of education shall be determined and gauged not so much by the financial ability of the parents but by the mental ability and energy of a child to absorb the learning at a college. This should appeal to General Johnson, who says I am a smart man, since, had I enjoyed the learning and college training which my plan would provide for others, I might not have fallen into the path of the dangerous menace and demagogue that he has now found me to be.\n","Remember, we have $65 billion to account for that would lie in the hands of the United States, even after providing home comforts for all families. We will use a large part of it immediately to expand particularly the colleges and universities of this country. You would not know the great institutions like Yale, Harvard, and Louisiana State University. Get ready for a surprise. College enrollments would multiply 1,000 percent. We would immediately call in the architects and engineers, the idle professors and scholars of learning. We would send out a hurry call because the problem of providing college education for all of the youth would start a fusillade of employment which might suddenly and immediately make it possible for us to shorten the hours of labor, even as we contemplate in the balance of our program.\n","And how happy the youth of this land would be tomorrow morning if they knew instantly their right to a home and the comforts of a home and to complete college and professional training and education were assured! I know how happy they would be, because I know how I would have felt had such a message been delivered to my door.\n","I cannot deliver that promise to the youth of this land tonight, but I am doing my part. I am standing the blows; I am hearing the charges hurled at me from the four quarters of the country. It is the same fight which was made against me in Louisiana when I was undertaking to provide the free school books, free busses, university facilities, and things of that kind to educate the youth of that State as best I could. It is the same blare which I heard when I was undertaking to provide for the sick and the afflicted. When the youth of this land realizes what is meant and what is contemplated the billingsgate and the profanity of all the Farleys and Johnsons in America can't prevent the light of truth from hurling itself in understandable letters against the dark canopy of the sky.\n","Now, when we have landed at the place where homes and comforts are provided for all families and complete education and training for all young men and women, the next problem is what about our income to sustain our people thereafter. How shall that be arranged to guarantee all the fair share of what soul and body need to sustain them conveniently. That brings us to our next point. We propose:\n","Number 3: We shall shorten the hours of labor by law so much as may be necessary that none will be worked too long and none unemployed. We shall cut the hours of toil to 30 hours per week, maybe less; we may cut the working year to 11 months' work and 1 month's vacation; maybe less. If our great improvement programs show we need more labor than we may have, we will lengthen the hours as convenience requires. At all events, the hours for production will be gauged to meet the market for consumption. We will need all our machinery for many years, because we have much public improvement to do; and, further, the more use that we may make of them, the less toil will be required for all of us to survive in splendor.\n","Now, a minimum earning would be established for any person with a family to support. It would be such a living which one, already owning a home, could maintain a family in comfort, of not less than $2,500 per year to every family.\n","And now by reason of false statements made, particularly by Mr. Arthur Brisbane and Gen. Hugh S. Johnson, I must make answer to show you that there is more than enough in this country and more than enough raised and made every year to do what I propose.\n","Mr. Brisbane says I am proposing to give every person $15,000 for a home and its comforts, and he says that would mean the United States would have to be worth over a trillion dollars. Why make that untrue statement, Mr. Brisbane? You know that is not so. I do not propose any home and comfort of $15,000 to each person -- it is a minimum of $5,000 to every family, which would be less than $125 billion, which is less than one-third of this Nation's wealth in normal times of $400 billion.\n","General Johnson says that my proposal is for $5,000 guaranteed earning to each family, which he says would cost from four to five hundred millions of dollars per year, which he says is four times more than our whole national income ever has been. Why make such untrue statements, General Johnson? Must you be a false witness to argue your point? I do not propose $5,000 income per year to each family. I propose a minimum of from $2,000 to $2,500 income per year to each family. For 25 million families that minimum income per family would require from $50 billion to $60.6 billion. In the prosperous days we have had nearly double that for income some years already, which allowed plenty for the affluent; but with the unheard prosperity we would have, if all our people could buy what they need, our national income would be double what it has ever been.\n","The Wall Street writer and statistician says we could have an income of at least $10,000 to every family in goods if all worked short hours and none were idle. According to him, only one-fourth of the average income would carry out my plan.\n","And now I come to the remainder of the plan. We propose:\n","Number 4: That agricultural production will be cared for in the manner specified in the Bible. We would plow under no crops; we would burn no corn; we would spill no milk into the river; we would shoot no hogs; would slaughter no cattle to be rotted. What we would do is this:\n","We would raise all the cotton that we could raise, all the corn that we could raise, and everything else that we could raise. Let us say, for example, that we raised more cotton than we could use.\n","But here again I wish to surprise you when I say that if everyone could buy all the towels, all the sheets, all the bedding, all the clothing, all the carpets, all the window curtains, and all of everything else he reasonably needs; America would consume 20 million bales of cotton per year without having to sell a bale to the foreign countries. The same would be true of the wheat crop, and of the corn crop, and of the meat crop. Whenever everyone could buy the things he desires to eat, there would be no great excess in any of those food supplies.\n","But for the sake of the argument, let us say, however, that there would be a surplus. And I hope there will be, because it will do the country good to have a big surplus. Let us take cotton as an example. Let us say that the United States will have a market for 10 million bales of cotton and that we raise 15 million bales of cotton. We will store 5 million bales in warehouses provided by the Government. If the next year we raise 15 million bales of cotton and only need 10, we will store another 5 million bales of cotton, and the Government will care for that. When we reach the year when we have enough cotton to last for twelve or eighteen months, we will plant no more cotton for that next year. The people will have their certificates of the Government which they can cash in for that year for the surplus, or if necessary, the Government can pay for the whole 15 million bales of cotton as it is produced every year; and when the year comes that we will raise no cotton, we will not leave the people idle and with nothing to do. That is the year when, in the cotton States, we will do our public improvement work that needs to be done so badly. We will care for the flood-control problems; we will extend the electricity lines into rural areas; we will widen roads and build more roads; and if we have a little time left, some of us can go back and attend a school for a few months and not only learn some of the things we have forgotten but we can learn some things that they have found out about that they didn't know anything about when we were children.\n","Now the example of what we would do about cotton is the same policy we would follow about all other crops. This program would necessitate the building of large storage plants, both heated and cold storage, and warehouses in all the counties of America, and that building program alone would take up all the idle people that America has today. But the money spent would go for good and would prevent any trouble happening in the future. And then there is another good thing. If we would fill these warehouses, then if there were to come a year of famine there would be enough on hand to feed and clothe the people of the Nation. It would be the part of good sense to keep a year or two of stock on hand all the time to provide for an emergency, maybe to provide for war or other calamity.\n","I give you the next step in our program:\n","Number 5: We will provide for old-age pensions for those who reach the age of 60 and pay it to all those who have an income of less than $1,000 per year or less than $10,000 in property or money. This would relieve from the ranks of labor those persons who press down the price for the use of their flesh and blood. Now the person who reaches the age of 60 would already have the comforts of home as well as something else guaranteed by reason of the redistribution that had been made of things. They would be given enough more to give them a reasonably comfortable existence in their declining days. However, such would not come from a sales tax or taxes placed upon the common run of people. It would be supported from the taxes levied on those with big incomes and the yearly tax that would be levied on big fortunes, so that they would always be kept down to a few million dollars to any one person.\n","Number 6: We propose that the obligations which this country owes to the veterans of its wars, including the soldiers' bonus and to care for those who have been either incapacitated or disabled, would be discharged without stint or unreasonable limit. I have always supported each and every bill that has had to do with the payment of the bonus due to the ex-service men. I have always opposed reducing the allowances which they have been granted. It is an unfair thing for a country to begin its economy while big fortunes exist by inflicting misery on those who have borne the burden of national defense.\n","Now, ladies and gentlemen, such is the share-our-wealth movement. What I have here stated to you will be found to be approved by the law of our Divine Maker. You will find it in the Book of Leviticus, from the twenty-fifth to the twenty-seventh chapters. You will find it in the writings of King Solomon. You will find it in the teachings of Christ. You will find it in the words of our great teachers and statesmen of all countries and of all times. If you care to write to me for such proof, I shall be glad to furnish it to you, free of expense, by mail.\n","Will you not organize a share-our-wealth society in your community tonight or tomorrow to place this plan into law?

Thank you, Margaret. And thank all of you very much. I haven't heard such cheers since I told the Washington Press Corps I was leaving town. I don't know who cheered the loudest -- them or me.\n","Frankly, for a minute there I was a bit concerned that after all these years away from Washington you all wouldn't recognize me. Heck, pretty soon I'm going to have to get one of those credit cards with my picture on the front.\n","I can't tell you how thrilled Nancy and I are to be here with you tonight to celebrate, as Margaret [Thatcher] said, the \"forty-fourth anniversary of my thirty-ninth birthday.\"\n","Haley [Barbour] told me he was going to gather a few friends for dinner tonight, but I had no idea! Before I get started here, I want to thank my dear friend, Margaret Thatcher, for being part of yet another important milestone -- another important milestone in my life and for those very kind words.\n","As most of you know, Margaret and I go back quite a ways. We met at a time before she became Prime Minister and I became President. From the moment we met, we discovered that we shared quite similar views of government and freedom. Margaret ended our first meeting by telling me, \"We must stand together,\" and that's exactly what we've done in the years since--as friends -- as friends and as political allies.\n","Margaret Thatcher is one of the giants of our century. Her many achievements will be appreciated more and more as time goes on and history is written. For me, she has been a staunch ally, my political soul mate, a great visionary, and a dear, dear friend. Thank you, Margaret, for being with us tonight.\n","I would also like to convey my personal appreciation to Haley Barbour. Haley, you and the entire Republican National Committee are doing an excellent job keeping the heat on the Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Haley, back when I hired you to work on my White House staff, I suspected you might amount to something someday.\n","I must say that returning to Washington today really brought back memories. As our plane headed toward the airport, I looked down on the White House, and it was just like the good old days -- the Rose Garden, the South Lawn, David Gergen. I looked over a couple of blocks, and there was the Internal Revenue Service -- bigger than I ever remembered it. Then I looked down at the enormous United States Post Office building. I could just see the excitement on the faces of the bureaucrats -- knowing they would soon be managing our national health care system. Up on Capital Hill, I saw that big, white dome, bulging with new tax revenues. I instinctively reached for my veto pen and thought to myself, \"Go ahead, make my day.\"\n","You may have seen President Clinton draw his own veto pen on television just last week. The difference is that his pen doesn't have any ink in it. Unless, of course, you're talking about red ink. And we all know the Democrats have plenty of that.\n","All of you have made our day, just by being here. It's a pleasure to see so many familiar faces and those who work so hard for the Grand Old Party -- which reminds me: I need to set the record straight once and for all on a certain matter that keeps coming up. I have to admit, I'm very flattered by all the phone calls, the letters, the signs, and especially those bumper stickers. But, with all I've got going in my life right now, I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to run again for President in ' 96 -- 1996. However, I have not ruled out the possibility of running in the year 2000.\n","I hesitate to ask. But if I did run could I count on you again for your support?\n","Seriously, birthdays often serve as the rare moments when we can pause from the bustle of our daily lives to reflect on the years that have passed, the accomplishments and people that have made them special. As I look around this gathering, I am filled with countless warm and fond memories. Many of you go back with us as far as my two terms as California Governor. Others of you are more recent additions to the family. Regardless of when you came, you have been a big part of our lives. For that, we are so grateful and feel so blessed.\n","Now, as most of you know, I'm not one for looking back, I figure there will be plenty of time for that when I get old. But rather what I take from the past is inspiration for the future. And what we accomplished during our years in the White House must never be lost amid the rhetoric of political revisionists.\n","When we came to Washington on that bright sunny day in January of 1981, we shared a dream for America. Back then, the reach of government had become intolerable. It was a time of rampant inflation and crushing interest rates -- when hope was scarce. It was a time when cold, ugly walls divided nations and human rights were trampled in the name of evil and corrupt ideologies. It was a time when the nuclear arms race was spiraling out of control and a blinding mistrust stood between East and West.\n","We believed that for the future of America and the free world, this could not stand. And together, we insisted that this great nation must once again behave as such. In our America, most people still believed in the power of a better tomorrow. So together we got the government off the backs of the American people.\n","We created millions of new jobs for Americans at all income levels.\n","We cut taxes and freed the people from the shackles of too much government. And, the economy burst loose in the longest peacetime expansion ever.\n","We brought America back -- bigger and better than ever.\n","It was a time when America was a bright beacon of hope and freedom to oppressed people everywhere. The world looked to us not just because of our military might but because of our ideas of liberty and freedom. And they knew we were willing to defend and promote those ideas in every corner of the earth.\n","We rebuilt a demoralized, under-funded and unappreciated military. And we made it the most modern and respected force in the world.\n","And who can forget those so-called \"experts\" who said our military build-up threatened a dangerous escalation of tensions? \"What kind of fool,\" they asked, \"would call the Soviet Union an 'evil empire.'\" I'm tempted to say, \"There's no fool like an old fool.\"\n","But as events have shown, there was nothing foolish in my prediction that communism was destined for the ash-heap of history. After decades of struggle, and with the help of the bold leadership of Margaret Thatcher, democracy won the Cold War and the Berlin Wall came tumbling down. The world watched with amazement as we put our house in order and took our rightful place as the most dynamic country in the world. And I firmly believe that history will record our era as one of peace and global prosperity.\n","However, our task is far from over. Our friends in the other Party will never forgive us for our success and are doing everything in their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression -- filled with suffering and despair. I don't know about you, but I'm getting awfully tired of whining voices from the White House these days.\n","They were claiming there was a decade of greed and neglect. Well you and I know better than that.\n","Although the political landscape has changed, the bold ideas of the 1980s are alive and well. Republican candidates swept every major election across the country last year. From New York to Texas -- from New Jersey to my home state of California. And as a result, it seems that our opponents have finally realized how unpopular liberalism really is.\n","So now, they're trying to dress their liberal agenda in a conservative overcoat. After watching the State of the Union address the other night, I'm reminded of the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny -- the intellectual theft of ideas that you and I recognize as our own. Speech delivery counts for little on the world stage unless you have convictions and, yes, the vision to see beyond the front row seats. The Democrats may remember their lines, but how quickly they forget the lessons of the past.\n","I have witnessed five major wars in my lifetime, and I know how swiftly storm clouds can gather on a peaceful horizon. The next time a Saddam Hussein takes over Kuwait, or North Korea brandishes a nuclear weapon, will we be ready to respond? In the end, it all comes down to leadership. And that is what this country is looking for now.\n","It was leadership here at home that gave us strong American influence abroad and the collapse of imperial communism. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we should always be cautious of those who would lower our profile because they might just wind up lowering our flag.\n","I don't think an event of this kind would be complete without something that you probably got used to during my days in Washington: one of my stories. It's a story about a woman who walked into a bridal shop one day and told the sales clerk that she was looking for a wedding gown for her fourth wedding.\n","Well the saleswoman asked, \"Just exactly what type of dress are you looking for?\"\n","\"A long, flowing white dress with a veil,\" she responded with assurance.\n","Not totally convinced, but afraid to offend the woman, the sales lady said, \"You know, dresses of that nature are usually more appropriate for brides who are being married for the first time -- for those a bit more innocent, if you know what I mean.\"\n","Well the lady retorted and put her hand on her hip, \"I do know what you mean and I can assure you I'm as innocent as the rest of them, despite all of my marriages. I remain as innocent as any first-time bride. You see my husband was a dear, sweet man. It was a terrible tragedy, actually. All of the excitement of the wedding was simply too much for him and he died as we checked into the hotel on our wedding night.\"\n","\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" said the clerk, \"but what about the others?\"\n","\"Well my second husband and I got into a terrible fight in the limousine on the way to our wedding reception. We haven't spoken since -- and got the marriage quickly annulled.\"\n","\"What about your third husband?\" asked the store clerk.\n","\"Well,\" the woman replied, \"he was a Democrat and every night for four years he just sat on the edge of the bed and told me how good it was going to be.\"\n","Sorry, I just couldn't resist telling that one.\n","My friends, on a serious note, I would like to end by telling you something that Nancy and I have wanted to say to you for a long time. During our years together here, as you know, things were always on the move. As soon as we accomplished one objective, we were quick on to the next. There was rarely time to celebrate victory or recall all the people who made it possible.\n","Well, one of the benefits of retirement is you get a chance to reflect back over the years. Since Nancy and I have returned to California, we've spent many occasions looking back at what we did here and remembering the extraordinary people who worked so hard to make those great days possible. And we've wondered if we would ever get the chance to thank them. Well, you are those people, those great individuals who gave so much of yourselves, who sacrificed and supported us and helped us achieve everything we did.\n","So, I will conclude tonight by saying the greatest gift I could receive on my birthday is to be able to stand before each and every one of you and convey in the only words I can how grateful Nancy and I are: thank you for being there -- and for being here. And thank you for making this evening a memory I will cherish forever.\n","And until we meet again, God bless you, my friends. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," \"we must stand together,\" says Margaret Thatcher. she is a staunch ally, my political soul mate, great visionary, and dear, dear friend, he says. \"it was like the good old days -- the Rose Garden,\" she tells me. the white house is doing an excellent job keeping the heat on the Democrats. --------------------------\n","671 \n","Original text: This is a war of ideals, and the other speakers here tonight are rightfully, idealists. I’m not. I’m a realist. I’m here to win. I have a single goal this evening – to have at least a plurality of you walk out of the “Aye” door. I face a singular challenge – most, if not all, of you have already made up your minds. This issue is too polarizing for the vast majority of you not to already have a set opinion. I’d be willing to bet that half of you strongly support the motion, and half of you strongly oppose it. I want to win, and we’re destined for a tie. I’m tempted to do what my fellow speakers are going to do – simply rehash every bad thing the Israeli government has ever done in an attempt to satisfy those of you who agree with them. And perhaps they’ll even guilt one of you rare undecided into voting for the proposition, or more accurately, against Israel. It would be so easy to twist the meaning and significance of international “laws” to make Israel look like a criminal state. But that’s been done to death. It would be easier still to play to your sympathy, with personalized stories of Palestinian suffering. And they can give very eloquent speeches on those issues. But the truth is that treating people badly, whether they’re your citizens or an occupied nation, does not make a state “rogue.” If it did, Canada, the US, and Australia would all be rogue states based on how they treat their indigenous populations. Britain’s treatment of the Irish would easily qualify them to wear this sobriquet. These arguments, while emotionally satisfying, lack intellectual rigor. More importantly, I just don’t think we can win with those arguments. It won’t change the numbers. Half of you will agree with them, half of you won’t. So I’m going to try something different, something a little unorthodox. I’m going to try and convince the die-hard Zionists and Israel supporters here tonight to vote for the proposition. By the end of my speech, I will have presented five pro-Israel arguments that show Israel is if not a “rogue state” then at least “rogue-ish.” Let me be clear. I will not be arguing that Israel is “bad.” I will not be arguing that it doesn’t deserve to exist. I won’t be arguing that it behaves worse than every other country. I will only be arguing that Israel is “rogue.” THE WORD “rogue” has come to have exceptionally damning connotations. But the word itself is value-neutral. The OED defines rogue as “Aberrant, anomalous; misplaced, occurring (esp. in isolation) at an unexpected place or time,” while a dictionary from a far greater institution gives this definition: “behaving in ways that are not expected or not normal, often in a destructive way.” These definitions and others center on the idea of anomaly – the unexpected or uncommon. Using this definition, a rogue state is one that acts in an unexpected, uncommon or aberrant manner. A state that behaves exactly like Israel. The first argument is statistical. The fact that Israel is a Jewish state alone makes it anomalous enough to be dubbed a rogue state: There are 195 countries in the world. Some are Christian, some Muslim, some are secular. Israel is the only country in the world that is Jewish. Or, to speak mathmo for a moment, the chance of any randomly chosen state being Jewish is 0.0051%. In comparison the chance of a UK lottery ticket winning at least £10 is 0.017% – more than twice as likely. Israel’s Jewishness is a statistical aberration. The second argument concerns Israel’s humanitarianism – in particular, Israel’s response to a refugee crisis. Not the Palestinian refugee crisis – for I am sure that the other speakers will cover that – but the issue of Darfurian refugees. Everyone knows that what happened, and is still happening in Darfur, is genocide, whether or not the UN and the Arab League will call it such. There has been a mass exodus from Darfur as the oppressed seek safety. They have not had much luck. Many have gone north to Egypt – where they are treated despicably. The brave make a run through the desert in a bid to make it to Israel. Not only do they face the natural threats of the Sinai, they are also used for target practice by the Egyptian soldiers patrolling the border. Why would they take the risk? Because in Israel they are treated with compassion – they are treated as the refugees that they are – and perhaps Israel’s cultural memory of genocide is to blame. The Israeli government has even gone so far as to grant several hundred Darfurian refugees citizenship. This alone sets Israel apart from the rest of the world. But the real point of distinction is this: The IDF sends out soldiers and medics to patrol the Egyptian border. They are sent looking for refugees attempting to cross into Israel. Not to send them back into Egypt, but to save them from dehydration, heat exhaustion, and Egyptian bullets. Compare that to the US’s reaction to illegal immigration across their border with Mexico. The American government has arrested private individuals for giving water to border crossers who were dying of thirst – and here the Israeli government is sending out its soldiers to save illegal immigrants. To call that sort of behavior anomalous is an understatement. My third argument is that the Israeli government engages in an activity which the rest of the world shuns – it negotiates with terrorists. Forget the late PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, a man who died with blood all over his hands. They’re in the process of negotiating with terrorists as we speak. Yasser Abed Rabbo is one of the lead PLO negotiators that has been sent to the peace talks with Israel. Abed Rabbo also used to be a leader of the PFLP – an organization of “freedom fighters” that engaged in such freedom-promoting activities as killing 22 Israeli high school students. And the Israeli government is sending delegates to sit at a table with this man and talk about peace. And the world applauds. You would never see the Spanish government in peace talks with the leaders of the ETA – the British government would never negotiate with Thomas Murphy. And if President Obama were to sit down and talk about peace with Osama Bin Laden, the world would view this as insanity. But Israel can do the exact same thing – and earn international praise in the process. That is the dictionary definition of rogue – behaving in a way that is unexpected, or not normal. Another part of dictionary definition is behavior or activity “occurring at an unexpected place or time.” When you compare Israel to its regional neighbors, it becomes clear just how roguish Israel is. And here is the fourth argument: Israel has a better human rights record than any of its neighbors. At no point in history has there ever been a liberal democratic state in the Middle East – except for Israel. Of all the countries in the Middle East, Israel is the only one where the LGBT community enjoys even a small measure of equality. In Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar and Syria, homosexual conduct is punishable by flogging, imprisonment, or both. But homosexuals there get off pretty lightly compared to their counterparts in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, who are put to death. Israeli homosexuals can adopt, openly serve in the army, enter civil unions and are protected by exceptionally strongly worded anti-discrimination legislation. Beats a death sentence. In fact, it beats America. Israel’s protection of its citizens’ civil liberties has earned international recognition. Freedom House is an NGO that releases an annual report on democracy and civil liberties in each of the 195 countries in the world. It ranks each country as “free,” “partly free” or “not free.” In the Middle East, Israel is the only country that has earned designation as a “free” country. Not surprising given the level of freedom afforded to citizens in say, Lebanon – a country designated “partly free,” where there are laws against reporters criticizing not only the Lebanese government, but the Syrian regime as well. Iran is a country given the rating of “not free,” putting it alongside China, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Myanmar. In Iran, there is a special “press court” which prosecutes journalists for such heinous offenses as criticizing the ayatollah, reporting on stories damaging the “foundations of the Islamic republic,” using “suspicious (i.e., Western) sources,” or insulting Islam. Iran is the world leader in terms of jailed journalists, with 39 reporters (that we know of) in prison as of 2009. They also kicked out almost every Western journalist during the 2009 election. I guess we can’t really expect more from a theocracy. Which is what most countries in the Middle East are – theocracies and autocracies. But Israel is the sole, the only, the rogue, democracy. Out of all the countries in the Middle East, only in Israel do anti-government protests and reporting go unquashed and uncensored. I have one final argument -- the last nail in the opposition’s coffin – and it’s sitting right across the aisle. Mr. Ran Gidor’s presence here is all the evidence any of us should need to confidently call Israel a rogue state. For those of you who have never heard of him, Mr. Gidor is a political counselor attached to Israel’s embassy in London. He’s the guy the Israeli government sent to represent them to the UN. He knows what he’s doing. And he’s here tonight. And it’s incredible. Consider, for a moment, what his presence here means. The Israeli government has signed off to allow one of their senior diplomatic representatives to participate in a debate on their very legitimacy. That’s remarkable. Do you think for a minute that any other country would do the same? If the Yale University Debating Society were to have a debate where the motion was “This house believes Britain is a racist, totalitarian state that has done irrevocable harm to the peoples of the world,” would Britain allow any of its officials to participate? No. Would China participate in a debate about the status of Taiwan? Never. And there is no chance in hell that an American government official would ever be permitted to argue in a debate concerning its treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. But Israel has sent Mr. Gidor to argue tonight against a 19-year-old law student who is entirely unqualified to speak on the issue at hand. Every government in the world should be laughing at Israel right now, because it forgot rule number one. You never add credence to crackpots by engaging with them. It’s the same reason you won’t see Stephen Hawking or Richard Dawkins debate David Icke. But Israel is doing precisely that. Once again, behaving in a way that is unexpected, or not normal. Behaving like a rogue state. That’s five arguments that have been directed at the supporters of Israel. But I have a minute or two left. And here’s an argument for all of you – Israel willfully and forcefully disregards international law. In 1981 Israel destroyed Osirak – Saddam Hussein’s nuclear bomb lab. Every government in the world knew that Hussein was building a bomb. And they did nothing. Except for Israel. Yes, in doing so they broke international law and custom. But they also saved us all from a nuclear Iraq. That rogue action should earn Israel a place of respect in the eyes of all freedom-loving peoples. But it hasn’t. But tonight, while you listen to us prattle on, I want you to remember something: While you’re here, Khomeini’s Iran is working towards the Bomb. And if you’re honest with yourself, you know that Israel is the only country that can, and will, do something about it. Israel will, out of necessity, act in a way that is the not the norm, and you’d better hope that they do it in a destructive manner. Any sane person would rather a rogue Israel than a nuclear Iran. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," this is a war of ideals, and the other speakers here tonight are rightfully, idealists.

I'm -- I'm honored to have this opportunity to represent my -- my fellow players.\n","Growing up in the Chicago suburbs, I was a college football junkie. My mom attended the University of Iowa and so I can remember I used to run around the backyard in a number 6, Tim Dwight Iowa jersey when I was very little.\n","Being in the Chicago-land area growing up, I also attended several Northwestern games during the days of Steve Schnur and Darnell Autry and D'wayne Bates and a certain linebacker, number 51 -- I heard he was okay; he's here with us today.\n","In high school, I -- I twice attended Purdue's Quarterback Camp, dreaming of one day playing for the -- the school known as the \"Cradle of Quarterbacks.\" Coming out of high school, however, I wasn't a decorated recruit.

And he said they'd be interested in recruiting me. Obviously I was very excited and three weeks later he called me and told me they were going to offer me a scholarship. And I made sure I committed to them right then and there before he changed his mind.\n","The opportunity to play in the Big Ten was one that I could not pass up. And as I now head into my final season at Michigan State, I've taken some time to reflect upon what has already occurred in a very fast and a very full four years. I'm sure many of my peers up here with me have done likewise.\n","If I were to categorize my experiences while being a part of the Big Ten, I would place much of what has already occurred under the heading: \"Privilege.\"\n","It has been a privilege to play football in the Big Ten.\n","It has been a privilege to play college football and to do so in the greatest conference in the country. While many children dream of playing college football, relatively few have the opportunity. And to be living that dream is a privilege.\n","It has been a privilege to play home games in Spartan Stadium, in front of the fans that make up the Spartan Nation, who live and die, figuratively speaking, based on our team's performance each Saturday in the fall. I'm sure the experience of my peers playing at the other 11 schools is no different.\n","It has been a privilege to go to places like Happy Valley, and play a team coached by a man who embodies what it means to have a calling in life and who proves that you can have success with integrity.\n","It has been a privilege to play in games that are televised all over the country and to then come home and catch the highlights afterward. While we all dreamt of playing on TV one day, to actually be doing it is an honor.\n","It is a privilege to be covered by all sorts of media people -- as we've experienced the past couple of days -- who make their living by following what we do on the field, off the field, in season and out of season.\n","It has been an incredible privilege to have the opportunity to speak to young people -- children, middle school and high school students, and high school athletes, in assemblies, chapels, graduations, and other assorted gatherings, due to the platform of playing football in the Big Ten.\n","It's been a privilege to hear these kids' questions, like the grade school boy who wanted to know if I wished I were as good as Denard Robinson. I told him, \"yes,\" but then added, \"I've heard Denard's only wish is that he could run like me.\" The boy looked back at me a little -- looked back at me a little confused, understandably.\n","It's been a privilege to be sought out by young fans, looking for an autograph on a picture or a piece of scrap paper. It's very humbling yet a privilege, nonetheless.\n","It's been a privilege to be a member of a team, to come together with a hundred other guys, and to work to accomplish something that none of us could accomplish on our own. The memories of Saturdays in the fall, as well as the early morning workouts in January and February, will remain with each one of us for the rest of our lives, as will the relationships that have been built between us.\n","I see it as a privilege to have spent the past four years in an environment where life lessons are learned on a daily basis; and they will no doubt be put to use in the years to come.\n","As I said in the beginning, it has been a privilege to play football in the Big Ten.\n","And it's here, in this place of privilege, where perhaps danger lies. I have been taught that human nature is such that the \"place of privilege\" most often and most naturally leads to \"a sense of entitlement\" -- the notion that I deserve to be treated as special, because I'm privileged.\n","The truth is, privilege should never lead to entitlement. I've been raised and taught to believe that privilege should lead to responsibility -- in fact, to greater responsibility. The Bible says in Luke 12:48: \"From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\"\n","Being a college football player in today's culture is a privilege -- a privilege that brings much responsibility.\n","We, as players, have a responsibility to give our all for fans who spend hard-earned money to watch us play.\n","We have a responsibility to represent the name on the front of our jerseys, on and off the field, in such that a way that our fellow students, faculty, administrators, and alumni have good reason to say: \"He's one of ours.\"\n","We have a responsibility to represent the name on the back of our jerseys in such a way that our parents, brothers, sisters, and other family members have good reason to say: \"He's one of us.\"\n","We have a responsibility to work hard in the classroom, as good stewards of the education that has been given to many of us free of charge.\n","We have a responsibility to treat, with respect, the people who cover us in the media.\n","We have a responsibility to use the platform we've been given to provide a true example of what it means to be a young man to those 10 and 12-year-old boys who see us as bigger than life. I know this to be true because just a few short years ago I was one of those 12-year-old boys, and I remember well how I looked up to the players whose position, by God's grace, I'm standing in today.\n","We have a responsibility to develop and use our God-given talents to their fullest potential and to do so in a way that honors God and benefits others.\n","I don't believe it's too far-fetched to think that we as college football players could make a significant, positive difference in the youth culture of America simply by embracing the responsibilities that accompany this place of privilege.\n","We could redefine what is \"cool\" for young people.\n","We could set a new standard for how to treat others.\n","We could embody what it means to be a person of integrity.\n","We could show to young people that excellence in the classroom is a worthy pursuit.\n","We could show that it's more important to do what is right than to do what feels right.\n","While I believe we as players do not deserve the platform we've been given, we have it, nonetheless. It comes with the territory of being a college football player in the Big Ten.\n","May we as players have the wisdom to handle this privilege and the courage to fulfill the responsibility we've been given.\n","Thank you and GO GREEN. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," in high school, I twice attended Purdue's Quarterback Camp, dreaming of one day playing for the school. coach dantonio of Michigan State said they'd be interested in recruiting me, he told me they were going to offer me a scholarship. the opportunity to play in the Big Ten was one that I could not pass up. --------------------------\n","673 \n","Original text: [This] country needs every ounce of its energy to restore itself.

I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today.\n","Over the last three years, I have been privileged to address this Committee on numerous occasions -- and to partner with many of you -- in advancing the goals and the priorities that we share. I am extremely proud of the Department’s historic achievements over the last two years. Despite significant financial constraints, we have effectively confronted a range of national security threats and public safety challenges.\n","I’m especially pleased to report that our efforts to combat global terrorism have never been stronger. Since I last appeared before this Committee in May -- just three days after the decade-long manhunt for Osama bin Laden came to a successful end -- the Department has achieved several additional milestones. For example, last month, we secured a conviction against Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab for his role in the attempted bombing of an airplane traveling from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. We also worked closely with our domestic and international partners to thwart an attempted plot -- allegedly involving elements of the Iranian government -- to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States on American soil. We have also disrupted numerous alleged plots by homegrown violent extremists -- including one targeting a military recruiting center in Washington State and another targeting U.S. soldiers in Texas. Meanwhile, in one of the most complex counter-intelligence operations in history, we brought down a ring involving 10 Russian spies. And just last week, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Viktor Bout, one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers, for his efforts to sell millions of dollars-worth of weapons -- including 800 surface-to air-missiles and 30,000 AK-47s -- for use in killing Americans.\n","On other fronts, the Department has made extraordinary progress in protecting civil rights, combating financial fraud, safeguarding our environment, and advancing our fight against violent crime. We have filed a record number of criminal civil rights cases. And, in the last fiscal year, our Civil Rights Division’s Voting Section opened more investigations, participated in more cases, and resolved more matters than in any other similar time period in the last dozen years. This section is also immersed in reviewing over 4,500 submissions for review under Section 5, including redistricting plans and other proposed state and local election-law changes that would impact the access some Americans would have to the ballot box.\n","We’ve also worked to ensure that states do not institute an unconstitutional patchwork of immigration laws. In recent months, the Department has challenged immigration-related laws in several states that directly conflict with the enforcement of federal immigration policies. Not only would these laws divert critical law enforcement resources from the most serious public safety threats, they can lead to potentially discriminatory practices and undermine the vital trust between local jurisdictions and the communities they serve.\n","The Department also has focused its efforts on the fight against financial fraud over the last two years -- by spearheading the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force and successfully executing the largest financial and health-care fraud takedowns in history. In addition, we secured a conviction in the biggest bank fraud prosecution in a generation, taking down a nearly three billion dollar fraud scheme. And, through our aggressive enforcement of the False Claims Act, a law significantly strengthened in recent years by this Committee, we’ve secured record-setting recoveries that have exceeded eight billion dollar since January 2009.\n","I am proud of these -- and our many other -- achievements. And, I am committed to building on this progress. Although I hope to spend much of our time together discussing the work that’s ongoing throughout the Department, I’d like to take a moment to address the public safety crisis of guns flowing across our border into Mexico -- and the local law enforcement operation known as “Fast and Furious” that has brought renewed public attention to this shared national security threat.\n","I want to be clear: any instance of so-called “gun walking” is unacceptable. Regrettably, this tactic was used as part of Fast and Furious, which was launched to combat gun trafficking and violence on our Southwest Border. This operation was flawed in concept, as well as in execution. And, unfortunately, we will feel its effects for years to come as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crimes scenes both here and in Mexico. This should never have happened. And it must never happen again.\n","To ensure that it will not, after learning about the allegations raised by ATF agents involved with Fast and Furious, I took action. I asked the Department’s Inspector General to investigate the matter, and I ordered that a directive be sent to the Department’s law enforcement agents and prosecutors stating that such tactics violate Department policy and will not be tolerated. More recently, the new leadership at ATF has implemented reforms to prevent such tactics from being used in the future, including stricter oversight procedures for all significant investigations.\n","Today, I would like to correct some of the inaccurate -- and irresponsible -- accusations surrounding Fast and Furious. Some of the overheated rhetoric might lead you to believe that this local, Arizona-based operation was somehow the cause of the epidemic of gun violence in Mexico. In fact, Fast and Furious was a flawed response to, not the cause of, the flow of illegal guns from the United States into Mexico.\n","As you all know, the trafficking of firearms across our Southwest Border has long been a serious problem -- one that has contributed to approximately 40,000 deaths in the last five years. As Senator Feinstein highlighted just last week, of the nearly 94,000 guns that have been recovered and traced in Mexico in recent years, over 64,000 were sourced to the United States.\n","The mistakes of Operation Fast and Furious, serious though they were, should not deter or distract us from our critical mission to disrupt the dangerous flow of firearms along our Southwest Border. I have supported a number of aggressive, innovative steps to do so and our work has yielded significant successes. We’ve built crime-fighting capacity on both sides of the border by developing new procedures for using evidence gathered in Mexico to prosecute gun traffickers in U.S. courts; by training thousands of Mexican prosecutors and investigators; by successfully fighting to enhance sentencing guidelines for convicted traffickers and straw purchasers; and by pursuing coordinated, multi-district investigations of gun-trafficking rings.\n","This year alone, we have led successful investigations into the murders of U.S. citizens in Mexico, created new cartel-targeting prosecutorial units, and secured the extradition of 104 defendants wanted by U.S. law enforcement -- including the former head of the Tijuana Cartel. This work has undoubtedly saved and improved lives in the United States as well as Mexico. I am personally committed to combating gun trafficking and reducing the alarming rate of violence along the Southwest Border by using effective -- and appropriate -- tools.\n","Like each of you, I want to know why and how firearms that should have been under surveillance could wind up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels. But beyond identifying where errors occurred and ensuring that they never occur again, we must be careful not to lose sight of the critical problem that this flawed investigation has highlighted: we are losing the battle to stop the flow of illegal guns to Mexico. That means we have a responsibility to act. And, we can start by listening to the agents who serve on the front lines of this battle. Not only did they bring the inappropriate and misguided tactics of Operation Fast and Furious to light, they also sounded the alarm to Congress that they need our help.\n","ATF agents who testified before a House committee this summer explained that the agency’s ability to stem the flow of guns from the United States into Mexico suffers from a lack of effective enforcement tools. One critical first step should be for Congressional leaders to work with us to provide ATF with the resources and statutory tools it needs to be effective, Another would be for Congress to fully fund our request for teams of agents to fight gun trafficking. Unfortunately, earlier this year the House of Representatives actually voted to keep law enforcement in the dark when individuals purchase multiple semi-automatic rifles and shotguns in Southwest border gun shops. Providing law enforcement with the tools to detect and disrupt illegal gun trafficking is entirely consistent with the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens and it is critical to addressing the public safety crisis on the Southwest border.\n","As someone who has seen the consequences of gun violence firsthand -- and who has promised far too many grieving families that I would do everything in my power not only to seek justice on behalf of their loved ones, but also to prevent other families from experiencing similar tragedies -- I am determined to ensure that our shared concerns about Operation Fast and Furious lead to more than headline-grabbing Washington “gotcha” games and cynical political point scoring.\n","We have serious problems to address -- and sacred responsibilities to fulfill. We must not lose sight of what’s really at stake here: lives, futures, families, and communities. When it comes to protecting our fellow citizens -- and stopping illegal gun trafficking across our Southwest Border -- I hope we can engage in a responsible dialogue and work toward common solutions. And, I hope we can begin that discussion today. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," despite significant financial constraints, we have effectively faced national security threats and public safety challenges. the department has achieved several additional milestones since we last appeared before this committee in May - just three days after the decade-long manhunt for osama bin Laden came to a successful end in january. we also worked closely with our domestic and international partners thwart an attempted plot allegedly involving elements of the Iranian government. --------------------------\n","675 \n","Original text: Let me say first of all that I am very deeply grateful to my good friend, Dick Gephardt. I couldn't help but -- when my side maybe overreacted to your statement ending 40 years of Democratic rule -- that I couldn't help but look over at Bob Michel, who has often been up here and who knows that everything Dick said was true -- that this is difficult and painful to lose, and on my side of the aisle, we have for 20 elections been on the losing side.\n","And yet there is something so wonderful about the process by which a free people decides things -- that, in my own case, I lost two elections, and with the good help of my friend Vic Fazio, came close to losing two others. And I'm sorry, guys, it just didn't quite work out. And yet I can tell you that every time when the polls closed and I waited for the votes to come in, I felt good, because win or lose, we've been part of this process. In a little while, I'm going to ask the dean of the House, John Dingell, to swear me in, to insist on the bipartisan nature of the way in which we together work in this House. John's father was one of the great stalwarts of the New Deal, a man who, as an FDR Democrat, created modern America. And I think that John and his father represent a tradition that we all have to recognize and respect, and recognize that the America we are now going to try to lead grew from that tradition and is part of that great heritage.\n","I also want to take just a moment to thank Speaker Foley, who was extraordinarily generous, both in his public utterances and in everything that he and Mrs. Foley did to help Marianne and me, and to help our staff make the transition. I think that he worked very hard to reestablish the dignity of the House. And I think that we can all be proud of the reputation that he takes and of the spirit with which he led the speakership. And our best wishes go to Speaker and Mrs. Foley.\n","I also want to thank the various House officers, who have been just extraordinary. And I want to say for the public record that faced with a result none of them wanted, in a situation I suspect none of them expected, but within 48 hours every officer of this House reacted as a patriot, worked overtime, bent over backwards, and in every way helped us. And I am very grateful, and this House I think owes a debt of gratitude to every officer that the Democrats elected two years ago. Thank you.\n","This is a historic moment. I was asked over and over, how did it feel, and the only word thats [sic] comes close to adequate is \"overwhelming.\" I feel overwhelmed in every way, overwhelmed by all the Georgians who came up, overwhelmed by my extended family that is here, overwhelmed by the historic moment. I walked out and stood on the balcony just outside the Speaker's office, looking down the Mall this morning, very early. And I was just overwhelmed by the view, which two men I've introduced and know very, very well -- [indecipherable] of us know very, very well. Just the sense of being part of America, being part of this -- this great tradition.\n","I have two gavels, actually. Dick happened to use one that -- maybe this was appropriate. This is a Georgia gavel I just got this morning, done by Dorsey Newman of Tallapoosa, who decided that the gavels he saw on TV weren't big enough or strong enough, so he cut down a walnut tree in his backyard, made a gavel, put a commemorative item [on it] and sent it up here. So this is a genuine Georgia gavel. I'm the first Georgia Speaker in over a hundred years. The last one, by the way, had a weird accent, too. Speaker Crisp was born in Britain. His parents were actors and they came to the U.S. -- a good word, by the way, for the value we get from immigration.\n","And secondly, this is the gavel that Speaker Martin used. Now I'm not sure what it says about the inflation of Government, if you put them side by side, but this was the gavel used by the last Republican Speaker. And -- And I want to comment for a minute on two men who served as my leader, and from whom I learned so much and who are here today.\n","When I arrived as a freshman, the Republican Party, deeply dispirited by Watergate and by the loss of the Presidency, banded together and worked with a leader who helped pave the way for our great Party victory of 1980, and a man who just did a marvelous job. And I can't speak too highly of what I learned about integrity and leadership and courage from serving with him in my freshman term. And he's here with us again today. Hope all of you will recognize Congressman John Rhodes of Arizona. Let me say also that at our request, he wasn't sure he should be here at all, then he thought he was going to hide in the back of the room. And then I insisted that he come down front, somebody who I regard as a mentor. I think virtually every Democrat in the House will say is a man who genuinely cares about and loves the House and who represents the best spirit of the House, a man who I've under and who I hope as Speaker I can always rely on for advice; and who I hope frankly I can emulate in his commitment to this institution and in his willingness to try to reach beyond his personal interest and his personal partisanship. I hope all of you will join me in thanking for his years of service, Congressman Bob Michel of Illinois.\n","I'm -- I'm very fortunate today. I have my Mom and my Dad are here. They're right up there -- Bob and Kit Gingrich. And I am so delighted that they were both able to be here. You know, sometimes when you get to my age, you can't have everyone near you you'd like to. I can't say how much I learned from my Dad and his years of serving the U.S. Army and how much I learned from my Mother, who is clearly my most enthusiastic cheerleader. My daughters are here up there [in the gallery] -- Kathy Lovewith and her husband Paul, and Jackie and her husband Mark Zyler. And the person who clearly is my closest friend and my best adviser and who, if I listened to about 20 percent more, I'd get in less trouble, my wife Marianne, is there.\n","I have a very large extended family between Marianne and me. And they're virtually all in town, and we've done our part for the Washington tourist season. But I couldn't help -- 'cause when I first came on the floor earlier, I went around and saw a number of the young people who are here -- a number of the children who are on the floor, the young adults, who are close to 12 years of age. And I couldn't help but think that sitting in the back rail near the center of...the House are my -- one of my nephews, Kevin McPherson, who is five; and Susan Brown, who is six; and Emily Brown, who is eight; and Laura McPherson, who is nine. And they're all back there -- I think probably more than allowed to bring on, but they're my nieces and my nephew. And I have two other nephews who are a little older who are actually up in the gallery.\n","I couldn't help but think, as a way I wanted to start the Speakership and to talk with every Member, that in a sense these young people you see around you are really what, at its best, this is all about. Much more than the -- the negative advertising and the interest groups and the -- all the different things that make politics all too often cynical and nasty and sometimes frankly just plain miserable. What makes politics worthwhile is that the choice, as Dick Gephardt said, between what we see so tragically on the evening news and the way we try to do it is to work very hard to make this system of free, representative self-government work.\n","And the ultimate reason for doing that is these children, and the country they will inherit, and the world they will live in. I -- we're starting the 104th Congress. I don't know if you've ever thought about the concept, but for 208 years, we gather together -- the most diverse country in the history of the world. We send all sorts of people. Each of us could find at least one Member we thought was weird. And I'll tell you, if you went around the room the person chosen to be weird would be different for virtually every one of us. Because we do allow and insist upon the right of a free people to send an extraordinary diversity of people here.\n","Brian Lamb of C-SPAN read to me Friday a phrase from de Tocqueville that was so central to the House. I've been reading Remini's biography of Henry Clay. And Henry Clay always preferred the House. He was the first strong Speaker. And he preferred the House to the Senate, although he served in both. Well he said the House is more vital, more active, more dynamic, more common.\n","And this is what de Tocqueville wrote (quote):\n","\"Often there is not a distinguished man in the whole number. Its members are almost all obscure individuals whose names bring no associations to mind. They are mostly village lawyers, men in trade, or even persons belonging to the lower classes of society.\"\n","Now, if you put women in with men, I don't know that we'd change much.\n","But the word \"vulgar\" in de Tocqueville's time had a very particular meaning. And it's a meaning the world would do well to study in this room. You see, de Tocqueville was an aristocrat. He lived in a world of kings and princes. And the folks who come here come here by the one single act that their citizens freely chose them.\n","And I don't care what your ethnic background -- what your ideology. I don't care whether you're younger or older. I don't care whether you were born in America or you're a naturalized citizen. Every one of the 435 people have equal standing because their citizens freely sent them, and their voice should be heard, and they should have a right to participate. And it is the most marvelous act of a complex, giant country trying to argue and talk -- and, as Dick [Gephardt] said, to have a great debate, to reach great decisions, not through a civil war, not by bombing one of our regional capitals, not by killing a half million people, not by having snipers -- and let me say unequivocally I condemn all acts of violence against the law by all people for all reasons. This is a society of law and a society of civil behavior.\n","Here we are as commoners together, to some extent Democrats and Republicans, to some extent liberals and conservatives, but Americans all. Steve Gunderson today gave me a copy of the \"Portable Abraham Lincoln.\" He suggested there is much for me to learn about our party, but I would also say that it does not hurt to have a copy of the portable F.D.R. This is a great country of great people. If there is any one factor or acts of my life that strikes me as I stand up here as the first Republican in 40 years to do so. When I first became whip in 1989, Russia was beginning to change, the Soviet Union as it was then. Into my whip's office one day came eight Russians and a Lithuanian, members of the Communist Party, newspaper editors. They asked me, \"What does a whip do?\" They said, \"In Russia we have never had a free parliament since 1917 and that was only for a few months, so what do you do?\" I tried to explain, as Dave Bonior or Tom DeLay might now. It is a little strange if you are from a dictatorship to explain you are called the whip but you do not really have a whip, you are elected by the people you are supposed to pressure -- other members. If you pressure them too much they will not reelect you. On the other hand If you do not pressure them enough they will not reelect you.\n","Democracy is hard. It is frustrating. So our group came into the Chamber. The Lithuanian was a man in his late sixties, and I allowed him to come up here and sit and be Speaker, something many of us have done with constituents. Remember, this is the very beginning of perestroika and glasnost. When he came out of the chair, he was physically trembling. He was almost in tears. He said, \"Ever since World War II, I have remembered what the Americans did and I have never believed the propaganda. But I have to tell you, I did not think in my life that I would be able to sit at the center of freedom.\" It was one of the most overwhelming, compelling moments of my life. It struck me that something I could not help but think of when we were here with President Mandela. I went over and saw Ron Dellums and thought of the great work Ron had done to extend freedom across the planet. You get that sense of emotion when you see something so totally different than you had expected. Here was a man who reminded me first of all that while presidents are important, they are in effect an elected kingship, that this and the other body across the way are where freedom has to be fought out. That is the tradition I hope that we will take with us as we go to work.\n","Today we had a bipartisan prayer service. Frank Wolf made some very important points. He said, \"We have to recognize that many of our most painful problems as a country are moral problems, problems of dealing with ourselves and with life.\" He said character is the key to leadership and we have to deal with that. He preached a little bit. I do not think he thought he was preaching, but he was. It was about a spirit of reconciliation. He talked about caring about our spouses and our children and our families. If we are not prepared to model our own family life beyond just having them here for 1 day, if we are not prepared to care about our children and we are not prepared to care about our families, then by what arrogance do we think we will transcend our behavior to care about others?\n","That is why with Congressman Gephardt's help we have established a bipartisan task force on the family. We have established the principle that we are going to set schedules we stick to so families can count on time to be together, built around school schedules so that families can get to know each other, and not just by seeing us on C-SPAN. I will also say that means one of the strongest recommendations of the bipartisan committee, is that we have 17 minutes to vote. This is the bipartisan committee's recommendations, not just mine. They pointed out that if we take the time we spent in the last Congress where we waited for one more Member, and one more, and one more, that we literally can shorten the business and get people home if we will be strict and firm. At one point this year we had a 45-minute vote. I hope all of my colleagues are paying attention because we are in fact going to work very hard to have 17 minute votes and it is over.\n","So, leave on the first bell, not the second bell. Okay?\n","This may seem particularly inappropriate to say on the first day because this will be the busiest day on opening day in congressional history. I want to read just a part of the Contract With America. I don't mean this as a partisan act, but rather to remind all of us what we are about to go through and why. Those of us who ended up in the majority stood on these steps and signed a contract, and here is part of what it says: On the first day of the 104th Congress the new Republican majority will immediately pass the following reforms aimed at restoring the faith and trust of the American people in their government:\n","First, require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also to apply equally to the Congress.\n","Second, select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of the Congress for waste, fraud or abuse.\n","Third, cut the number of House committees and cut committee staffs by a third.\n","Fourth, limit the terms of all committee chairs.\n","Fifth, ban the casting of proxy votes in committees.\n","Sixth, require committee meetings to be open to the public.\n","Seven, require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase.\n","Eight, guarantee an honest accounting of our federal budget by implementing zero baseline budgeting.\n","Now, I told Dick Gephardt last night that if I had to do it over again we would have pledged within 3 days that we will do these things, but that is not what we said. So we have ourselves in a little bit of a box here.\n","Then we go a step further. I carry the TV Guide version of the contract with me at all times. We then say that within the first 100 days of the 104th Congress we shall bring to the House floor the following bills, each to be given full and open debate, each to be given a full and clear vote, and each to be immediately available for inspection. We made it available that day. We listed 10 items.\n","A balanced budget amendment and line-item veto,\n","A bill to stop violent criminals, emphasizing among other things an effective and enforceable death penalty.\n","Third was welfare reform.\n","Fourth, legislation protecting our kids.\n","Fifth was to provide tax cuts for families.\n","Sixth was a bill to strengthen our national defense.\n","Seventh was a bill to raise the senior citizens` earning limit.\n","Eighth was legislation rolling back Government regulations.\n","Ninth was a commonsense legal reform bill, and\n","tenth was congressional term limits legislation.\n","Our commitment on our side, and this is an absolute obligation, is first of all to work today until we are done. I know that is going to inconvenience people who have families and supporters. But we were hired to do a job, and we have to start today to prove we will do it. Second, I would say to our friends in the Democratic Party that we are going to work with you, and we are really laying out a schedule working with the minority leader to make sure that we can set dates certain to go home. That does mean that if 2 or 3 weeks out we are running short we will, frankly, have longer sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. We will try to work this out on a bipartisan basis to, in a workmanlike way, get it done. It is going to mean the busiest early months since 1933.\n","Beyond the Contract I think there are two giant challenges. I know I am a partisan figure. But I really hope today that I can speak for a minute to my friends in the Democratic Party as well as my own colleagues, and speak to the country about these two challenges so that I hope we can have a real dialog.\n","One challenge is to achieve a balanced budget by 2002. I think both Democratic and Republican Governors will say we can do that but it is hard. I do not think we can do it in a year or two. I do not think we ought to lie to the American people. This is a huge, complicated job.\n","The second challenge is to find a way to truly replace the current welfare state with an opportunity society. Let me talk very briefly about both challenges. First, on the balanced budget I think we can get it done. I think the baby boomers are now old enough that we can have an honest dialog about priorities, about resources, about what works, and what does not work. Let me say I have already told Vice President Gore that we are going to invite him to address a Republican conference. We would have invited him in December but he had to go to Moscow, I believe there are grounds for us to talk together and to work together, to have hearings together, and to have task forces together.\n","If we set priorities, if we apply the principles of Edwards, Deming and of Peter Drucker we can build on the Vice President's reinventing government effort and we can focus on transforming, not just cutting. The choice becomes not just do you want more or do you want less, but are there ways to do it better? Can we learn from the private sector, can we learn from Ford, IBM, from Microsoft, from what General Motors has had to go through? I think on a bipartisan basis we owe it to our children and grandchildren to get this Government in order and to be able to actually pay our way. I think 2002 is a reasonable time frame. I would hope that together we could open a dialog with the American people.\n","I have said that I think Social Security ought to be off limits, at least for the first 4 to 6 years of the process, because I think it will just destroy us if we try to bring it into the game. But let me say about everything else, whether it is Medicare, or it is agricultural subsidies, or it is defense or anything that I think the greatest Democratic President of the 20th century, and in my judgment the greatest President of the 20th century, said it right.\n","On March 4, 1933, he stood in braces as a man who had polio at a time when nobody who had that kind of disability could be anything in public life. He was President of the United States, and he stood in front of this Capitol on a rainy March day and he said, `We have nothing to fear but fear itself.` I want every one of us to reach out in that spirit and pledge to live up to that spirit, and I think frankly on a bipartisan basis. I would say to Members of the Black and Hispanic Caucuses that I would hope we could arrange by late spring to genuinely share districts.\n","You could have a Republican who frankly may not know a thing about your district agree to come for a long weekend with you, and you will agree to go for a long weekend with them. We begin a dialog and an openness that is totally different than people are used to seeing in politics in America. I believe if we do that we can then create a dialog that can lead to a balanced budget. But I think we have a greater challenge. I do want to pick up directly on what Dick Gephardt said, because he said it right. No Republican here should kid themselves about it. The greatest leaders in fighting for an integrated America in the 20th century were in the Democratic Party. The fact is, it was the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that ended segregation. The fact is that it was Franklin Delano Roosevelt who gave hope to a Nation that was in distress and could have slid into dictatorship. Every Republican has much to learn from studying what the Democrats did right.\n","But I would say to my friends in the Democratic Party that there is much to what Ronald Reagan was trying to get done. There's much to what is being done today by Republicans like Bill Weld, and John Engler, and Tommy Thompson, and George Allen, and Christy Whitman, and Pete Wilson. There is much we can share with each other.\n","We must replace the welfare state with an opportunity society. The balanced budget is the right thing to do. But it does not in my mind have the moral urgency of coming to grips with what is happening to the poorest Americans. I commend to all Marvin Olasky's \"The Tragedy of American Compassion.\" Olasky goes back for 300 years and looked at what has worked in America, how we have helped people rise beyond poverty, and how we have reached out to save people. He may not have the answers, but he has the right sense of where we have to go as Americans. I do not believe that there is a single American who can see a news report of a 4-year-old thrown off of a public housing project in Chicago by other children and killed and not feel that a part of your heart went, too.\n","I think of my nephew in the back, Kevin, and how all of us feel about our children. How can any American read about an 11-year-old buried with his Teddy bear because he killed a 14-year-old, and then another 14-year-old killed him, and not have some sense of \"My God, where has this country gone?\" How can we not decide that this is a moral crisis equal to segregation, equal to slavery? How can we not insist that every day we take steps to do something? I have seldom been more shaken than I was after the election when I had breakfast with two members of the Black Caucus. One of them said to me, \"Can you imagine what it is like to visit a first-grade class and realize that every fourth or fifth young boy in that class may be dead or in jail within 15 years? And they are your constituents and you are helpless to change it?\"\n","For some reason, I do not know why, maybe because I visit a lot of schools, that got through. I mean, that personalized it. That made it real, not just statistics, but real people. Then I tried to explain part of my thoughts by talking about the need for alternatives to the bureaucracy, and we got into what I think frankly has been a pretty distorted and cheap debate over orphanages. Let me say, first of all, my father, who is here today, was a foster child. He was adopted as a teenager. I am adopted. We have relatives who were adopted. We are not talking out of some vague impersonal Dickens \"Bleak House\" middle-class intellectual model. We have lived the alternatives. I believe when we are told that children are so lost in the city bureaucracies that there are children who end up in dumpsters, when we are told that there are children doomed to go to schools where 70 or 80 percent of them will not graduate, when we are told of public housing projects that are so dangerous that if any private sector ran them they would be put in jail, and the only solution we are given is, `Well, we will study it, we will get around to it,` my only point is that this is unacceptable.\n","We can find ways immediately to do things better, to reach out, break through the bureaucracy and give every young American child a better chance. Let me suggest to you Morris Schectman's new book. I do not agree with all of it, but it is fascinating. It is entitled \"Working Without a Net.\" It is an effort to argue that in the 21st century we have to create our own safety nets. He draws a distinction between caring and caretaking. It is worth every American reading. He said caretaking is when you bother me a little bit, and I do enough, I feel better because I think I took care of you. That is not any good to you at all. You may be in fact an alcoholic and I just gave you the money to buy the bottle that kills you, but I feel better and go home. He said caring is actually stopping and dealing with the human being, trying to understand enough about them to genuinely make sure you improve their life, even if you have to start with a conversation like, \"If you will quit drinking, I will help you get a job.\" This is a lot harder conversation than, \"I feel better. I gave him a buck or 5 bucks.\"\n","I want to commend every Member on both sides to look carefully. I say to those Republicans who believe in total privatization, you cannot believe in the Good Samaritan and explain that as long as business is making money we can walk by a fellow American who is hurt and not do something. I would say to my friends on the left who believe there has never been a government program that was not worth keeping, you cannot look at some of the results we now have and not want to reach out to the humans and forget the bureaucracies. If we could build that attitude on both sides of this aisle, we would be an amazingly different place, and the country would begin to be a different place. We have to create a partnership. We have to reach out to the American people. We are going to do a lot of important things.\n","Thanks to the House Information System and Congressman Vern Ehlers, as of today we are going to be on line for the whole country, every amendment, every conference report. We are working with C-SPAN and others, and Congressman Gephardt has agreed to help on a bipartisan basis to make the building more open to television, more accessible to the American people. We have talk radio hosts here today for the first time. I hope to have a bipartisan effort to make the place accessible for all talk radio hosts of all backgrounds, no matter their ideology. The House Historian's office is going to be more aggressively run on a bipartisan basis to reach out to Close Up, and to other groups to teach what the legislative struggle is about. I think over time we can and will this Spring rethink campaign reform and lobbying reform and review all ethics, including the gift rule.\n","But that isn't enough. Our challenge shouldn't be just to balance the budget or to pass the Contract. Our challenge should not be anything that is just legislative. We are supposed to, each one of us, be leaders. I think our challenge has to be to set as our goal, and maybe we are not going to get there in 2 years. This ought to be the goal that we go home and we tell people we believe in: that there will be a Monday morning when for the entire weekend not a single child was killed anywhere in America; that there will be a Monday morning when every child in the country went to a school that they and their parents thought prepared them as citizens and prepared them to compete in the world market; that there will be a Monday morning where it was easy to find a job or create a job, and your own Government did not punish you if you tried. We should not be happy just with the language of politicians and the language of legislation.\n","We should insist that our success for America is felt in the neighborhoods, in the communities, is felt by real people living real lives who can say, \"Yes, we are safer, we are healthier, we are better educated, America succeeds.\" This morning's closing hymn at the prayer service was the Battle Hymn of the Republic. It is hard to be in this building, look down past Grant to the Lincoln Memorial and not realize how painful and how difficult that battle hymn is. The key phrase is, \"As he died to make men holy, let us live to make men free.\"\n","It is not just political freedom, although I agree with everything Congressman Gephardt said earlier. If you cannot afford to leave the public housing project, you are not free. If you do not know how to find a job and do not know how to create a job, you are not free. If you cannot find a place that will educate you, you are not free. If you are afraid to walk to the store because you could get killed, you are not free. So as all of us over the coming months sing that song, \"As he died to make men holy, let us live to make men free.\"\n","I want us to dedicate ourselves to reach out in a genuinely nonpartisan way to be honest with each other. I promise each of you that without regard to party my door is going to be open. I will listen to each of you. I will try to work with each of you. I will put in long hours, and I will guarantee that I will listen to you first. I will let you get it all out before I give you my version, because you have been patient with me today, and you have given me a chance to set the stage. But I want to close by reminding all of us of how much bigger this is than us. Because beyond talking with the American people, beyond working together, I think we can only be successful if we start with our limits.\n","I was very struck this morning with something Bill Emerson used, a very famous quote of Benjamin Franklin, at the point where the Constitutional Convention was deadlocked. People were tired, and there was a real possibility that the Convention was going to break up. Franklin, who was quite old and had been relatively quiet for the entire Convention, suddenly stood up and was angry, and he said: \"I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men, and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it possible that an empire can rise without His aid?\" At that point the Constitutional Convention stopped. They took a day off for fasting and prayer. Then, having stopped and come together, they went back, and they solved the great question of large and small States. They wrote the Constitution, and the United States was created.\n","All I can do is pledge to you that, if each of us will reach out prayerfully and try to genuinely understand each other, if we will recognize that in this building we symbolize America, and that we have an obligation to talk with each other, then I think a year from now we can look on the 104th Congress as a truly amazing institution without regard to party, without regard to ideology. We can say, \"Here America comes to work, and here we are preparing for those children a better future.\"\n","Thank you. Good luck and God bless you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the dean of the house, John Dingell, swears me in to insist on bipartisan nature of how we work in this House. john avlon: we all have to recognize and respect that the America we are now going to try to lead grew from that tradition and is part of that great heritage. --------------------------\n","676 \n","Original text: Mr. President, Mrs. Ford, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President-to-be, the distinguished guests here, and you ladies and gentlemen:\n","I'm going to say fellow Republicans here but those who are watching from a distance -- all those millions of Democrats and Independents who I know are looking for a cause around which to rally and which I believe we can give them.\n","Mr. President, before you arrived tonight, these wonderful people, here, when we came in, gave Nancy and myself a welcome. And that, plus this, and plus your kindness and generosity in honoring us by bringing us down here will give us a memory that will live in our hearts forever; watching on television these last few nights -- and I’ve seen you also with the warmth which you greeted Nancy, and you also filled my heart with joy when you did that.\n","May I just say some words?\n","There are cynics who say that a party platform is something that no one bothers to read and it doesn’t very often amount to much. Whether it is different this time than it has ever been before, I believe the Republican Party has a platform that is a banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades.\n","We have just heard a call to arms based on that platform, and a call to us to really be successful in communicating, and reveal to the American people the difference between this platform and the platform of the opposing party, which is nothing but a revamp and a reissue and a [re]running of a late, late show of the thing that we've been hearing from them for the last 40 years.\n","If I could just take a moment and -- I had an assignment the other day. Someone asked me to write a letter for a time capsule that is going to be opened in Los Angeles a hundred years from now, on our Tricentennial. It sounded like an easy assignment. They suggested I write something about the problems and issues of the day.\n","And I set out to do so, riding down the coast in an automobile, looking at the blue Pacific out on one side and the Santa Ynez Mountains on the other, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it was going to be that beautiful a hundred years from now as it was on that summer day.\n","And then as I tried to write -- let your own minds turn to that task. You’re going to write for people a hundred years from now who know all about us. We know nothing about them. We don’t know what kind of a world they’ll be living in. And suddenly I thought to myself, \"If I write of the problems, they’ll be the domestic problems of which the President spoke here tonight,\" the challenges confronting us: the erosion of freedom that has taken place under Democrat rule in this country; the invasion of private rights; the controls and restrictions on the vitality of the great free economy that we enjoy. These are our challenges that we must meet.\n","And then again there is that challenge of which he spoke that we live in a world in which the great powers have poised and aimed at each other horrible missiles of destruction, nuclear weapons that can in a matter of minutes arrive at each other’s country and destroy virtually the civilized world we live in.\n","And suddenly it dawned on me: Those who would read this letter a hundred years from now will know whether those missiles were fired. They will know whether we met our challenge.\n","Whether they have the freedoms that we have known up until now will depend on what we do here. Will they look back with appreciation and say, \"Thank God for those people in 1976 who headed off that loss of freedom? Who kept us now a hundred years later free? Who kept our world from nuclear destruction?\"\n","And if we failed they probably won’t get to read the letter at all because it spoke of individual freedom and they won’t be allowed to talk of that or read of it.\n","This is our challenge and this is why, here in this hall tonight, better than we’ve ever done before, we’ve got to quit talking to each other and about each other and go out and communicate to the world that, we may be fewer in numbers than we’ve ever been, but we carry the message they’re waiting for.\n","We must go forth from here united, determined. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," cynics say that a party platform is something that no one bothers to read. they say it's something we've been hearing from the opposing party for the last 40 years, and that it doesn't often amount to much. if it is different this time than it has ever been before, the Republican Party has an platform that is banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades. --------------------------\n","677 \n","Original text: Secretary Clinton: Thank you so very much for being here --\n","Audience Members: We love you all.\n","Secretary Clinton: And I love you all, too.\n","Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country.

But I feel -- I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together -- this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.\n","I -- I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.\n","We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our President.

He was hired on a consultant basis and was essentially carrying on the Army’s effort in both COMINT [\"Communications Intelligence] and COMSEC [\"Communications Security\"] as an individual.\n","He had one enlisted man working with him and one secretary. That was it. That was the whole U.S. Army effort. About 1929, Mr. Friedman got permission from the Signal Corps authorities -- specifically from the Chief Signal Officer -- to expand his effort with the idea of building up some additional capability in what we now call the cryptologic field.\n","Some thought was given to the general question of where to seek people for this kind of work. At that time, the hiring of employees within the Civil Service was done from what were known as \"Civil Service Registers.\" Each register was a list of names of people who had passed special Civil Service examinations.\n","Well, they decided that the mathematicians list was a good place to go, but they also thought that it would be useful to add a further requirement. And they considered that it would be useful to require that the people who would be considered should also have some competence in foreign language. So the idea was to go to the register. The one they went to was the one called \"Junior Mathematician.\"\n","Well, they decided they would go to that register of junior mathematicians and look at the list; select people from the list who had some language background; and then see what kind of employees could be hired from that list. Incidentally, this raised a little complication because in those days there was a rather strict regulation within the Civil Service Commission that if any government agency wanted to hire a person from a register -- no matter which one -- the selection had to be made from among the top three on the register itself. And unless one of those top three was selected, very definite reasons had to be provided for the rejection of all three and for the permission to dip down any deeper into the list.\n","Well, this was, to some extent overcome, because of the additional requirement of language which was imposed. And from that list, three names were selected after an examination of records and I guess after some correspondence. And the three people who were selected are sitting here in front of you: [Frank] Rowlett and Solomon Kullback and I.\n","We each had had some work in one foreign language in school. I had had a fair amount of work on French; Kullback had studied Spanish; and Rowlett’s language was German. We were hired and brought to Washington as a [sic] expansion of this organization, which was known as the Signal Intelligence Service -- the SIS.\n","Our coming increased the size of the establishment to the grand number of six. And we were put in a specially favored position because we were brought in by Mr. Friedman and we were at once put through what amounted to a very effective training program. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," some thought was given to the general question of where to seek people for this kind of work. at that time, the hiring of employees within the Civil Service was done from \"Civil Service Registers\" the list was a list of names of people who had passed special civil service examinations. --------------------------\n","679 \n","Original text: I am a strong believer in the importance of an Open Internet. As President Obama has explained, “Preserving an Open Internet is vital not just to the free flow of information, but also to promoting innovation and economic productivity.” That is why I have made preservation of the Open Internet a priority for the FCC.\n","Some recent commentary has had a misinformed interpretation of the Open Internet Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) currently before the Commission. There are two things that are important to understand. First, this is not a final decision by the Commission but rather a formal request for input on a proposal as well as a set of related questions. Second, as the Notice makes clear, all options for protecting and promoting an Open Internet are on the table.\n","I believe this process will put us on track to have tough, enforceable Open Internet rules on the books in an expeditious manner, ending a decade of uncertainty and litigation.\n","The idea of net neutrality (or the Open Internet) has been discussed for a decade with no lasting results. Today Internet Openness is being decided on an ad hoc basis by big companies. Further delay will only exacerbate this problem. The NPRM is seeking input on the best way to protect and promote the Open Internet.\n","In its Verizon v. FCC decision the D.C. Circuit laid out a blueprint for how the FCC could use Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to create Open Internet rules that would stick. I have repeatedly stated that I viewed the court’s ruling as an invitation that I intended to accept. We ask for comment on this approach in the NPRM.\n","I am concerned that acting in a manner that ignores the Verizon court’s guidance, or opening an entirely new approach, invites delay that could tack on multiple more years before there are Open Internet rules in place. We are asking for comment on a proposed a course of action that could result in an enforceable rule rather than continuing the debate over our legal authority that has so far produced nothing of permanence for the Internet.\n","I do not believe we should leave the market unprotected for multiple more years while lawyers for the biggest corporate players tie the FCC’s protections up in court. Notwithstanding this, all regulatory options remain on the table. If the proposal before us now turns out to be insufficient or if we observe anyone taking advantage of the rule, I won’t hesitate to use Title II. However, unlike with Title II, we can use the court’s roadmap to implement Open Internet regulation now rather than endure additional years of litigation and delay.\n","At the heart of the proposed NPRM is the assurance that it won’t be possible for an Internet provider to degrade the service available to all. Let me re-emphasize that: the Internet will remain like it is today, an open pathway. If a broadband provider (ISP) acts in a manner that keeps users from effectively taking advantage of that pathway then it should be a violation of the Open Internet rules.\n","There has been a great deal of discussion about how our proposal to follow the court’s roadmap will result in a so-called “fast lane” and Internet “haves” and “have-nots.” This misses the point. The proposed rule is built to ensure that everyone has access to an Internet that is sufficiently robust to enable consumers to access the content, services and applications they demand, as well as an Internet that offers innovators and edge providers the ability to offer new products and services.\n","The focus of this proposal is on maintaining a broadly available, fast and robust Internet as a platform for economic growth, innovation, competition, free expression, and broadband investment and deployment. Our goal is rules that will encourage broadband providers to continually upgrade service to all. We will follow the court’s blueprint, and I must warn you, we will look skeptically on special exceptions. The NPRM proposes such a policy, along with other important protections and reforms. The NPRM also proposes that the best way to accomplish this is by exercising the FCC’s authority as delineated by the D.C. Circuit under the “commercially reasonable” standard that the Commission has already implemented (and the court approved) in the Data Roaming Order.\n","Let me be clear, however, as to what I believe is not “commercially reasonable” on the Internet:\n","Something that harms consumers is not commercially reasonable. For instance, degrading service in order to create a new “fast lane” would be shut down.\n","Something that harms competition is not commercially reasonable. For instance, degrading overall service so as to force consumers and content companies to a higher priced tier would be shut down.\n","Providing exclusive, prioritized service to an affiliate is not commercially reasonable. For instance, a broadband provider that also owns a sports network should not be able to give a commercial advantage to that network over another competitive sports network wishing to reach viewers over the Internet.\n","Something that curbs the free exercise of speech and civic engagement is not commercially reasonable. For instance, if the creators of new Internet content or services had to seek permission from ISPs or pay special fees to be seen online such action should be shut down.\n","In other words, the Internet will remain an open pathway. If broadband providers would seek to use the commercially reasonable test as justification of activities in which users can’t effectively use that pathway, or the capabilities of it are degraded, I suggest they save their breath since such conduct would be a violation of the Open Internet rules we propose. If anyone acts to degrade the service for all for the benefit of a few, I intend to use every available power to stop it.\n","Using every power also includes using Title II if necessary. If we get to a situation where arrival of the “next Google” or the “next Amazon” is being delayed or deterred, we will act as necessary using the full panoply of our authority. Just because I believe strongly that following the court’s roadmap will enable us to have rules protecting an Open Internet more quickly, does not mean I will hesitate to use Title II if warranted.\n","There is an oft-overlooked and currently enforceable survivor from the 2010 Open Internet Order -- the transparency rule. The court affirmed the requirement that ISPs provide information to consumers and edge providers about their service. The proposed NPRM expands that transparency requirement to include specific disclosures that will give edge providers, large and small, the information they need to do their business -- including information that would “rat out” bad practices by ISPs. We will demand that ISPs exercise the same care with regard to these disclosures that they do with their filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penalties for the failure to fully disclose and/or perform consistently will be serious.\n","Even with an Open Internet there remains a shortfall in adequate broadband competition. I indicated in February my intention to address the matter of municipal ownership or sponsorship of competitive broadband networks. While that is not a matter that is appropriate for an Open Internet NPRM, it is an issue that remains high on my agenda and we will be announcing more on this topic shortly.\n","The question of how networks exchange Internet traffic, such as through peering, was outside of the scope of our 2010 Open Internet Order and thus is outside of the proposed scope of the Open Internet NPRM. However, we will seek comment on this question, in order to hear from those who may disagree with this suggested treatment of peering/traffic exchange.\n","It is important to remember, however, that the manner in which networks interconnect to exchange Internet traffic is a part of what I call the Network Compact, those values that have traditionally governed successful networks. Thus, it is a question that must concern the Commission. Right now, through both written filings in the \"remand\" docket and through presentations made by networks and others to the Commission, we are receiving points of view on the manner in which current traffic exchange regimes are, or are not, working. We encourage such dialogue with networks, edge providers and end users. The bottom line is that interconnection has always been a key component of telecom policy.\n","In summary, the simple fact is that the court has provided a legal roadmap for how we can protect net neutrality and do expeditiously. The recommendation on which we seek comment would result in timely and meaningful Open Internet rules. This NPRM means that consumers, startup innovators, venture capitalists, and others who have been waiting…and waiting…and waiting for the certainty of rules would finally have something on which they can rely. We have been talking about net neutrality for a decade; it is time to put something in place -- and to do it with dispatch. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the NPRM is seeking input on the best way to protect and promote the Open Internet. he is concerned that acting in a manner that ignores the Verizon court’s guidance, or opening an entirely new approach, invites delay that could tack on multiple more years before open Internet rules in place. --------------------------\n","680 \n","Original text: Oh, my. Julie¹, this is a lot like a wedding.\n","Anson, thank you so much for that [introduction]. A lot of people might not know but I...still haven't figured out if it was a good thing or a bad thing, but Anson² and -- and his wife, M'Liss, had power of attorney over me, after my parents. I was 17 years old when I went to college, and my parents went to live over in Italy, and so all major decisions -- I had to pass through him. But I am completely honored and -- and blessed that you were the one that stood up here today.\n","Whenever I give speeches -- Whenever I'm asked to talk, I -- I think about Anson and -- and the way he -- he so eloquently expresses his thoughts and his feelings; and I truly believe that is a gift. And, you know, for me -- Julie and I did talk about what we were going to say today. And -- And first I just want to start off by saying thank you, because there are so many thank yous to be said. First of all, to the Century Council, and the Hall of Fame and all its members and staff -- you guys are here -- for all you've done for me and my family in making this event absolutely wonderful, and memorable. So thank you so much.\n","I want to extend my congratulations and gratitude to fellow inductees, Alan Rothenberg -- any time you want to buy me a bottle of wine, Alan, just call me up. And Smitty3 -- I feel I can call you \"Smitty\" -- I've met your entire family, and your friends. I have to say, there [are] a couple I'm afraid of. But you can see the love and the passion that you have for them, so thank you for sharing them with us and it was wonderful to meet you guys -- especially you, Gabby4.\n","I also want to say congratulations to the '86 team. You guys, you basically established the standards that all of us had to live up to. I also wanted to send out my best to the current National Women's team. As Kristine5 said, they played last night; they defeated Finland 4-0; and they leave tomorrow -- yeah [audience applause] -- and they leave tomorrow for China, and I know that they will continue to make us proud.\n","And Jules¹: Man, I always have to follow Jules. You know, this event is so great and so wonderful, but it's even more so to the fact that I not only get to enter the Hall of Fame with one of my teammates, but one of my closest friends. And I think it's -- it's only fitting that she be inducted in the first ever female class. You have been such an ambassador, an advocate for young girls and women all over this country who are searching for a voice, and opportunities and ways to make a difference. I truly believe that your greatest hour is yet to come, and that we have only witnessed a small glimpse into what your impact and legacy will be.\n","You know, my life and -- and career have been a collaborative effort, and there are so many people -- many that are here today -- that have helped me arrive at this moment. And I want to say thank you. First of all to the fans -- you guys are the best. To -- To pull into a stadium and see your face painted and -- and there is, I will tell you, not a more humbling experience to walk into a stadium and see so many girls wearing your jersey. And I am so proud of that -- and I hope you can see that every time I took the field, that I was playing for you guys. So thank you so much.\n","To the media, who came out and on so many occasions when they probably thought they got the short end of the stick -- but came out and helped us create this wonderful, amazing revolution that you see out here today; that you will see in two weeks time at the Women's World Cup, and so I want to say thank you to them. U.S. Soccer and all the Women['s] National Team staff members, thank you for supporting this team, and as Julie said, \"setting the standard for all other national teams to follow.\"\n","To the W[U]SA, staff and investors, for believing in our dream and the dreams of so many young girls; and I promise you we will be back.\n","My sponsors, some who are here today -- Nike and Gatorade -- they supported me from the beginning, and they helped me realize not only the dream of being a professional, but of helping our sport grow to incredible heights that we never thought possible.\n","To Johnny Langel and his wife Jackie and their family, I can't even begin to think where we would be without you. Your wisdom and support has given us courage; and you always, always believed in us. (Yeah!)\n","My agents, Dave, Dan6 -- as my husband told me, they started off as -- as a business relationship, but they've become part of our family. And thank you for helping me learn and grow and get a greater sense of responsibility. And thank you for bringing in Michelle7 -- for helping us to continue the Mia Hamm Foundation, to make a positive impact in so many people's lives.\n","To my coaches -- and so many of them are here today -- Anson, Tony, Lauren, and Jim -- for realizing my potential and creating an environment that pushed me when I needed to be pushed, challenged me every single day to constantly improve, nurtured me when they saw that I needed it, and molding me not only into the player but to the person that I am today.\n","And thank you to all my teammates, from youth soccer, club, University of North Carolina, the Washington Freedom, and of course the Women's National Team. Anson would always say in one of his pre-games: You know why I love playing a team sport? Because there are going to be times out there when you're playing, when you're not at your best; and there are going to be times out there when you're playing and you are at your best, and you will carry this team; but when you're not at your best, they will carry you. And let me tell you, I have been carried much more than I have ever carried. So, thank you.\n","To my family -- so many are here today. I know there are some that can't be, and my thoughts and prayers are out there with them. You guys have been my rock, my biggest fans. And all that memories that I have: '96 Olympics; tie-dye shirts; walking into the first-ever Olympic stadium and seeing -- I can see my sister Lovdy now, wiping tears away, and we walked in; getting hugs from your nieces and nephews when you came off the field; all the trash talking that was done to the referees. This experience is nothing -- and I mean nothing -- without you. I love you, and thank you so much.\n","And to my husband, Nomar, you are beautiful in so many ways. And thank you so much for being here. I know it wasn't easy -- and I owe Grady a bottle of Champaign -- but I'm so grateful that you are here to share this moment with us as a family. And thank you for giving me the greatest moment in my life -- and that is seeing you with our girls for the very first time.\n","You know, I've thought a lot about what I wanted to say, and especially what I wanted to share to my girls, Ava and Grace, about my career, since they will never see me play. A friend once said to me, \"Two of the greatest gifts you can give your children are values and memories.\" So when I look back on my life at the values and memories that I have, so many of these lessons I learned are from this game, and through the relationships I have gained through it. And I'm not just talking about the victories and the occasional defeats. What I'm talking about are values and memories that are encompassed in words like \"friendship,\" \"hard work,\" \"sacrifice,\" \"compassion,\" \"dignity,\" \"love,\" \"respect,\" and \"perseverance.\"\n","Things that I have learned through this game that I would share with you: that girls should have every to compete and develop as boys; that there is no substitute for hard work; that the words \"you will pass out before you die,\" as we ran fitness still haunt me to this day; watching Kristine Lilly get her 100th cap, and then her 200th, and then her 300th; being able to watch the best player ever in Michelle Akers; that you have the power to define your own legacy; to always respect the game, as well as your opponents; that -- that dancing before a game and celebrating after you score a goal are a must; that referees and I \"always saw eye-to-eye\"; that second place is only second best if you allow it to be.\n","I learned about the joys of motherhood through Karla and Joy who so graciously shared their children with us. I learned that wanting to be the best, as well as being a team player, are not mutually exclusive; that a 0-0 game in 100 degree heat in the Rose Bowl can be one of the most exciting and life-changing sporting events in history; to always maintain humility in victory and defeat; and that there will always -- that there will be times when you're friends really are laughing at you and not with you; and most -- more importantly, that believing that we all can make a difference, that having a voice is one thing and using it is another.\n","And lastly, Grace and Ava, I hope and pray that you are as lucky as I was -- to be able to love what you do; and that your father and I have helped you find the strength and confidence to do it in your own way. And through the values that we share, and the memories that I share with you, that you will be able to create and experience your own. I love you, my sweet and beautiful girls.\n","Thank you, again, for this wonderful honor. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the century council, and the Hall of Fame and all its members and staff -- you guys are here -- thank you for all you've done for me and my family in making this event absolutely wonderful. if you want to buy me a bottle of wine, Alan, just call me up.

Casey administers the Oath of Office]\n","I, Ann Elizabeth Dunwoody, having been appointed an officer, in the Army of the United States, in the grade of General, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, [that] I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duty of the office upon which I am about to enter, so help me God.\n","Thank you. Secretary Gates, thank you. General Casey, thank you. Thank you, everyone. I wish I could begin to describe the incredible feelings of gratitude, humility, and love that are absolutely consuming me at this very moment -- but it's impossible.\n","Secretary Gates, I can't begin to tell you how much it means to the Dunwoody-Brotchie family that you took the time to be here today. Thank you so much for your support. Thanks for your kind words; and more importantly thank you for your service.\n","General Casey, thank you for hosting -- and honoring me and my family -- for hosting this ceremony today. Thank you for your trust and confidence. I know with this promotion comes a tremendous responsibility, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to continue to serve this great Army, in this critical time, in this new capacity.\n","Chaplain Carver, thank you for that uplifting blessing and that beautiful prayer.\n","Sergeant Bingham, thank you for giving us all goose bumps during that beautiful rendition of the National Anthem.\n","And to the entire protocol team and my special staff who pulled this all together -- no easy task -- thank you so much. Thank all of you.\n","Secretary Geren, Admiral Mullen, Mr. Clapper, Admiral Roughead, General Conway, Mrs. Casey, General Schwartz, General Reimer, Mrs. Shinseki, General Schoomaker, General Petraeus, Mr. Bell, Mr. Wilke, Mr. Ford, General Chiarelli, General Tilelli, General and Mrs. Cody, Mr. James, Mr. Cohen, Mr. and Mrs. Kunkle, General Griffin, General Salomon, General and Mrs. Wilson, General Coburn, General and Mrs. McNeill, and Sergeant-Major of the Army, Kenneth O. Preston, other distinguished guests, great friends, family members: Thank you so much for being here to share this special day. I know so many have come so far and we're truly grateful.\n","You know, I've had the chance and opportunity to be in audiences like the one assembled today, but I can assure you the view from up here is much different. It's as overwhelming as it is humbling, especially for someone who thought 5th grade was the best three years of her life.\n","Secretary Geren, in your opening remarks at AUSA this year at the convention, you mentioned that this was the year, the last for this Administration; the last this and the last that. And I couldn't help but think how fortunate I had been to have lived a lifetime of firsts. And it's been the Army -- this Army -- that has given me those opportunities.\n","And I stand before you today as one of the luckiest people in the world; lucky because I have been blessed in so many ways. I grew up in a wonderful family, very special family; and it was special because I had the best mom and dad a kid could ever ask for; and I had sisters and brothers who made growing up fun. Heck, all we ever worried about: Was dad going to let us stay up to watch the second half of Bonanza? And was Santa Clause really, really going to deliver the goods. Seriously, I'd wanted for nothing. And now, I have a wonderful husband, cute dog, great job, great friends, and we get to call Hawaii our home. And I thank the Lord for these blessings every day.\n","But the blessings don't stop there. My dad, who will soon be 90 years old, as you know is here today. That's him right there. Just six weeks ago he was seriously ill and had to undertake a -- a risky operation. Not only did he -- he survive the operation, but he was bound and determined to be here -- and here he is today. Talk about never quitting. Talk about never accepting defeat. That's my dad, my hero.\n","As you heard, dad's a West Point class of 1943; and his dad, Halsey, was West Point class of 1905; and his granddad, Henry, was West Point class of 1866. Now you understand why people think I have olive drab blood. As General Casey said, my dad was wounded both in World War II and Korean War, and was the recipient of two Purple Hearts, and recognized for valor with a Distinguished Service Cross. When people talk too him about his two Purple Hearts, he's quick to say he was just a slow learner. But we all know better. And dad I'm grateful for this opportunity to say thanks for your service to our nation and for instilling in me the timeless values of integrity, courage, and sense of values. And I know most of my success is founded in what I learned from you as a dad, as a patriot, and as a soldier.\n","I wish my mom could be here today, but I know she's here with us in spirit. But I know she's smiling because this event created another opportunity for a Dunwoody family get-together. But I'll tell you that my mom, a devout Catholic, was the strongest, most selfless, most caring, compassionate, loving person I have ever met. She pretty much raised all six of us on our own, while dad was serving our nation. But she always taught us the glass was always half full, and no matter what the challenge, no how matter -- no -- no matter how hard the road, that it would never rain on our parade. If there's anyone who deserves induction into the order of sainthood, it's my mother, and I miss her a lot.\n","But I'm really happy and glad that Craig's mom -- my other mom -- is here today all the way from San Bernardino, California. Helen, I know it wasn't an easy journey but thank you for making it.\n","I'd like to introduce the rest of the Dunwoody-Brotchie clan, all of who I'm so very proud of. My brother, Buck -- who's also West Point grad, class of '70 -- made a career in the business world after he did his time in the Army; and now has kind of put his life on hold to help care for my dad. My sister Sue, she was the third female helicopter pilot in our Army, and now continues to serve our Army at CENTCOM headquarters as a retiree recall. Her husband, Jim, is also here, is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and served our nation flying helicopters and A-10s. Their daughter, Captain Jenny Schoeck, is also an Air Force Academy grad, class of 2000, and like her dad she flies A-10s, and recently returned from flying combat missions in Afghanistan.\n","If anyone is worried about the next generation of warriors: fear not. The bench is loaded with talented Sailors, Airmen, Soldiers, and Marines. And while I know that I may be the first woman to achieve this honor, I know with certainty I won't be the last.\n","My other sister, Jackie, mother of two beautiful daughters, and her husband Steve are here from Arizona. Steve's a Vietnam Vet, and recently retired after 30 years as a Fire Department Captain and a paramedic, and we're glad they're both here. And one of their daughters, Brooke, and her husband Nicolai, are here. Brooke is on a full time scholarship for a Ph.D. at Duke University in a discipline I can hardly pronounce.\n","My brother, Bill, is here from Oklahoma. He's working on the new construction there at Fort Sill. Bill, thank you for being here and making our Dunwoody family reunion complete. And I'm really thrilled that Craig's two sons, my stepsons, Brian and Scott, are here as well -- all the way from Redlands, California, and Geneva Lakes, Wisconsin. I can't tell you how much it means that you're here. Brian's a PGA golf pro -- Hooah. (Anyone looking for lessons....) And Scott and his wife Alicia will deliver our first grandbaby next April. \"Grandson\" -- I stand corrected. Mr. Wonderful comes another time. Thank you.\n","We also have a ton of cousins from both sides of the family who are here to celebrate today. All of them have a special story. All are unique in their own way. Thank you for traveling to take part in this great with -- great day with us.\n","So here we are 33 years after I took the oath as a Second Lieutenant, and I have to tell you this is not exactly how I envisioned my life unfolding. Even as a young kid, all I ever wanted to do was teach Physical Education and raise a family. And I joined the Army right out of college. I got a direct commission as a Second Lieutenant with a two-year commitment. The offer was too good to refuse. They paid me 500 dollars a month during my senior year in college, and they sent me to Airborne School. I couldn't believe they were going to pay me to jump out of airplanes.\n","But it was always clear to me that my Army experience was just going to be a two year detour en route to my fitness profession. So when people ask me, \"Did you\" -- \"Ann, did you ever think you were going to be a general officer, [to] say nothing about a 4-Star?\" I say, not in my wildest dreams. There is no one more surprised than I -- except, of course, my husband. And you know what they say: Behind every successful woman there's an astonished man. So as to my childhood dreams -- while I'm still sorting the fitness business -- and my family -- there's nothing better than being a part of a huge Army family that I've come to love so much.\n","I attribute staying in the Army past my two years to my very first platoon sergeant, sergeant first class, Wendell Bowman, who took the training of second lieutenants very seriously. And I remember him telling me, \"I'm going to make you the best lieutenant in the United States Army.\" And a few weeks later he came back to me -- he said, \"Ma'am, you're really going to make me work at this, aren't you?\" That was 1976, a period we now refer to as a \"broken Army.\" But I can assure you, there was nothing broken about sergeant first class Wendell Bowman. He was the best NCO in the company, and he was tireless in enforcing and instilling the standards and values he knew to be the hallmark of our Army. And he is the reason I stayed.\n","But my husband, Craig, is the reason I'm still here. I met Craig 21 years ago when we were students at CGSC, and for those of you who know Craig, you know we did not meet in the library. Matter of fact, I -- I met him when we were taking the Army PT test. And he won the two-mile -- Army two-mile run by a wide margin. And I remember us Army guys kind of being a little ticked that this big Air Force guy could run faster than any of us. And I don't know if it were a matter because he was big or because he was Air Force, but that big Air Force guy became my running buddy and -- and the rest is history.\n","But Craig's a hero in his own right, but he's my hero too. He's a man of integrity, commitment, and compassion. And all you have to do is talk with anyone who's ever served with him and know -- to know and appreciate the respect and admiration they have for him. He served 26 years -- stellar years -- as an Air Force combat controller, and for the part -- and part of the joint special operations, he led the men who brought the air power to the ground fight. Craig shares laughter as easily as tears. He encourages me and he counsels me. And every day, and every now and then, he catches me off guard and interrupts me in whatever I'm doing and says, \"Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?\" I don't think I would be standing here today without him, but I know I would not have wanted to try.\n","This promotion has taken me back in time like no other event in my entire life. And I didn't appreciate the enormity of the event until the tidal waves of cards, letters, and emails started coming my way. And I've heard from men and women from every branch of service, from every region of our country, and every corner of the world. I've heard from moms and dads who see this promotion as a beacon of hope for their own daughters, and an affirmation that anything is possible through hard work and commitment. And I've heard from women veterans of all wars, many who just wanted to say \"congratulations,\" some who just wanted to say \"thanks,\" and still others just wanted to say they were so happy this day had finally come. And to all of them I owe a very special thanks for their dedication, for their commitment, and for paving the way.\n","And I know it might sound trite, but for me today is all about two simple words: Thank you. For this day has allowed me to reconnect with so many family members, friends, and mentors from my past -- those who have touched my life in so many ways. People like my best friend from 5th grade, Elaine Pierce, now Elaine Rins, and her husband Brad, who have joined us today. We hadn't been in contact for over 40 years. Her braces are gone, but the fun memories are still there and I now know there's more to come. And friends like Mary Ann Benca, from Randolph New York, population 1200. We used to spend our summers up there with our grandparents and Mary Ann became my \"every summer buddy.\" And she's here with us today.\n","Also here today are so many of our military friends -- Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines, civilians and spouses -- literally from every assignment I've ever had; and you honor us with your presence.\n","I also want to thank the courageous women that have made this journey with me -- great friends like Jan Edmunds, Barb Doornink, Pat Hickerson; women like Kris Drach, who were on point for the integration of women into the regular Army. They, too, led the way. Because of them, I was never alone. Because of them, I was never afraid. And leaders like Miss Kathy Condon, my colleague and 3-Star equivalent; Vice Admiral Ann Rondeau, Lieutenant General Kathy Gainey, women who have achieved so many, many firsts in their own career fields.\n","But I know I would not be standing here today had it not were for leaders who believed in me, leaders who took a chance on me, and leaders who not only encouraged me but inspired me to be the best I could be. Leaders like Colonel Henry Fitzpatrick, who's here today, my battalion commander from 1981. And leaders from my 82nd, 18th Airborne, color days, who helped kick down the doors in the Airborne community with me; leaders like Carl Freeman, Zannie Smith, General Dan McNeill, Stan Crystal, Dave Petraeus, General Hugh Shelton; and who could forget Chicken Man Wright.\n","There are also leaders who have challenged me with incredible opportunities, leaders who gave me so many of those first opportunities I mentioned earlier. Leaders like General Shinseki; leaders like Tom Glisson, General Reimer, General Griffin, General Schoomaker; and now General George Casey, and our Secretary.\n","How could I not be successful with a lineup of leaders, coaches, and mentors like that?\n","My final thank you is to our valiant Army, to the men and women our nation turns to time and time again, and to their heroic families who continue to sacrifice for all of us. The Army nurtured me and mentored me, and today the Army offers me the chance to return the favor; and I embrace this opportunity with open arms, and I do so with a deep commitment to the Army, with all the energy, strength, and determination of one proud soldier.\n","During this year's NFL induction Hall of Fame, I was moved when I heard the great receiver Art Monk say, from the day he donned his uniform football was all he ever wanted to do. And even though I thought I was only coming into the Army for two years, I now know, from the day I first donned my uniform, soldiering is all I ever wanted to do. I can't point to any one life-changing epiphany, but I now know the Army profession I'm so proud to be part of is a reflection of the very values I grew up [with] in the Dunwoody family.\n","General Casey, I'm honored to be joining your 4-Star bench of general officers: An extraordinary band of brothers who have the responsibility of guiding our nation's Army and its incredible soldiers into the future.\n","Thank you, and God bless all of you.\n","Also in this database: General Ann Dunwoody's Press Q&A\n","Research Note: Many thanks to Felicia R.

I began several years ago on a small chalkboard sitting in our kitchen -- a tradition that I’ve carried on every night -- that at the end of each day I have picked up the chalk and I’ve tried to express the many things you mean to me. Sometimes just a brief line, sometimes a short story, but always just the overflow from a grateful heart. And yet after these months and years of writing to you each night, I have never been at a shortage of ways to reflect the light that you’ve brought into my life. And now, how ironic that in these few short moments, I need to capture in words these things I so deeply appreciate in you. Maybe I can say it to you this simple way.\n","Not long ago we were on the road and I looked out our hotel room window from the upper floor of a very tall high-rise. I could see the rooftop of an old and beautiful cathedral. It was stunning with its carved stone and marble all done so perfectly. I could not believe the work of art I was seeing and I wondered -- how many years did it take them to create this, and what drove them to be this committed? Then I began to appreciate something greater.\n","I realized when this rooftop was built it was by far the tallest building. And in an age long before airplanes or skyscrapers these artists believed each day as they went about their work that no human being, no one set of eyes would ever see their creation. How could they not have cut one corner? How could they consider no task routine? I can only think it came from a deep place inside. The need to be true to themselves was their reason and their reward.\n","All of this has helped me to understand you just a little bit better: never needing applause to be at your best; only needing to give the best your soul could give to feel complete. From the roar of voices inside the lines of center court to the quietness of a child’s bedroom, that generous soul, that unbending strength, that soft-spoken integrity, has not one time been shaken. The arena of tennis simply gave you a platform and an opportunity to refine those inner qualities even more.\n","You have always been about the action, not about the words.\n","And even now it has taken my breath away to see that you’ve quietly laid down your racquet to pursue love and motherhood with the same zeal and high standards you have always demanded of yourself. No, no one has ever known you to be infatuated by your own accomplishments. In fact, as I have often said, anyone who speaks with you will most likely forget the great things you’ve done within thirty seconds. But they will feel cared for, their feelings engaged, and you never let go of their heart until that they know that they are completely understood.\n","The history books will record for posterity your ability to embrace and rise above adversity, to play through injury, and to win again, again, and again. Far in the future, people will analyze and discuss your place as the greatest of your time. And as those future generations hear of your strength and dominance, they may be tempted to think that they know you, or the real heart of a giant that beats inside of you.\n","But for those of us who are blessed to actually see, firsthand, your quiet humility, to watch you represent your sport with unmistakable dignity, and for those of us who are even more blessed to be lifted out of ourselves by your laughter, to be on the receiving end of your always generous heart, we have etched forever in us something a statistic could never contain: We have been touched deeply by your life; you have made us better; and we will never be the same.\n","Stephanie, you have spent many years of your life competing, but right here where we stand, in the ears of your children, and right now in my heart, you have no rival.\n","Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the greatest person I’ve ever known: Stephanie Graff. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the words have yet to be invented that are large enough, colorful enough or true enough to express the heart and soul of this woman that I love: Stephanie. in these short moments, I need to capture in words these things I so deeply appreciate in you. i can only think it came from a deep place inside. --------------------------\n","683 \n","Original text: Members of the Dail and Seanad, after all the long and torn history of our two peoples, standing here as the first British prime minister ever to address the joint Houses of the Oireachtas, I feel profoundly both the history in this event, and I feel profoundly the enormity of the honor that you are bestowing upon me. From the bottom of my heart, go raibh mile maith agaibh.\n","Ireland, as you may know, is in my blood. My mother was born in the flat above her grandmother's hardware shop on the main street of Ballyshannon in Donegal. She lived there as a child, started school there and only moved when her father died; her mother remarried and they crossed the water to Glasgow.\n","We spent virtually every childhood summer holiday up to when the troubles really took hold in Ireland, usually at Rossnowlagh, the Sands House Hotel, I think it was. And we would travel in the beautiful countryside of Donegal. It was there in the seas off the Irish coast that I learned to swim, there that my father took me to my first pub, a remote little house in the country, for a Guinness, a taste I've never forgotten and which it is always a pleasure to repeat.\n","Even now, in my constituency of Sedgefield, which at one time had 30 pits or more, all now gone, virtually every community remembers that its roots lie in Irish migration to the mines of Britain.\n","So like it or not, we, the British and the Irish, are irredeemably linked.\n","We experienced and absorbed the same waves of invasions: Celts, Vikings, Normans -- all left their distinctive mark on our countries. Over a thousand years ago, the monastic traditions formed the basis for both our cultures. Sadly, the power games of medieval monarchs and feudal chiefs sowed the seeds of later trouble.\n","Yet it has always been simplistic to portray our differences as simply Irish versus English -- or British. There were, after all, many in Britain too who suffered greatly at the hands of powerful absentee landlords, who were persecuted for their religion, or who were for centuries disenfranchised. And each generation in Britain has benefited, as ours does, from the contribution of Irishmen and women.\n","Today the links between our parliaments are continued by the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, and last month 60 of our MPs set up a new all-party \"Irish in Britain Parliamentary Group.\"\n","Irish parliamentarians have made a major contribution to our shared parliamentary history. Let me single out just two:\n","· Daniel O'Connell, who fought against injustice to extend a franchise restricted by religious prejudice;\n","· Charles Stewart Parnell, whose statue stands today in the House of Commons and whose political skills and commitment to social justice made such an impact in that House.\n","So much shared history, so much shared pain.\n","And now the shared hope of a new beginning.\n","The peace process is at a difficult juncture. Progress is being made, but slowly. There is an impasse over the establishment of the executive; there is an impasse over decommissioning. But I have been optimistic the whole way through. And I am optimistic now. Let us not underestimate how far we have come; and let us agree that we have come too far to go back now.\n","Politics is replacing violence as the way people do business. The Good Friday Agreement, overwhelmingly endorsed by the people on both sides of the Border, holds out the prospect of a peaceful long-term future for Northern Ireland, and the whole island of Ireland.\n","The Northern Ireland Bill provides for the new Assembly and Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council, and the British-Irish Council. It incorporates the principle of consent into British constitutional law and repeals the Government of Ireland Act of 1920. It establishes a Human Rights Commission with the power to support individual cases. We will have an Equality Commission to police a new duty on all public bodies in Northern Ireland to promote equality of opportunity. We have set up the Patten Commission to review policing. We are scaling down the military presence. Prisoners are being released.\n","None of this is easy. I get many letters from the victims of violence asking why we are freeing terrorist prisoners. It is a tough question but my answer is clear: the agreement would never have come about if we had not tackled the issue of prisoners. That agreement heralds the prospect of an end to violence and a peaceful future for Northern Ireland. Our duty is to carry it out. That is a duty I feel more strongly than ever, having seen for myself the horror of Omagh. This was not the first such atrocity. But with all of my being, I will it to be the last. I will never forget the meeting I had, with Bill Clinton, with survivors, and with relatives of those who died. Their suffering and their courage was an inspiration. They will never forget their loved ones. Nor must we. We owe it to them above all to build a lasting peace, when we have the best opportunity in a generation to do so.\n","The Taoiseach's personal contribution has been immense. I pay tribute to his tireless dedication. I value his friendship. I also salute the courage of our predecessors, Deputy Albert Reynolds, Deputy John Bruton and John Major; and I also salute Deputy Dick Spring, whose role in this process goes back a long way.\n","Like us, you are living up to your side of the bargain too. You have voted to end the territorial claim over Northern Ireland, essential to the agreement.\n","It is time now for all the parties to live up to all their commitments. Time for North/South bodies to be established to start a new era of co-operation between you and Northern Ireland -- I hope agreement on these is now close. Time to set up the institutions of the new government. Time for the gun and the threat of the gun to be taken out of politics once and for all; for decommissioning to start.\n","I am not asking anyone to surrender. I am asking everyone to declare the victory of peace.\n","In Belfast or Dublin, people say the same thing: make the agreement work.\n","It is never far from my mind. My sense of urgency and mission comes from the children in Northern Ireland. I reflect on those who have been victims of violence, whose lives are scarred and twisted through the random wickedness of a terrorist act, on those who grow up in fear, those whose parents and loved ones have died.\n","And I reflect on those, who though untouched directly by violence, are nonetheless victims -- victims of mistrust and misunderstanding who through lack of a political settlement miss the chance of new friendships, new horizons, because of the isolation from others that the sectarian way of life brings.\n","I reflect on the sheer waste of children taught to hate when I believe passionately children should be taught to think.\n","Don't believe anyone who says the British people don't care about the peace process. People in my country care deeply about it, are willing it to work. And in our two countries, it is not just the politicians who have a role to play.\n","No one should ignore the injustices of the past, or the lessons of history. But too often between us, one person's history has been another person's myth.\n","We need not be prisoners of our history. My generation in Britain sees Ireland differently today and probably the same generation here feels differently about Britain.\n","We can understand the emotions generated by Northern Ireland's troubles, but we cannot really believe, as we approach the 21st century, there is not a better way forward to the future than murder, terrorism and sectarian hatred.\n","We see a changed Republic of Ireland today:\n","· a modern, open economy;\n","· after the long years of emigration, people beginning to come back for the quality of life you now offer;\n","· a country part of Europe's mainstream, having made the most of European structural funds but no longer reliant on them;\n","· some of the best business brains in the business world;\n","· leaders in popular culture, U2, the Corrs, Boyzone, B-Witched;\n","· a country that had the courage to elect its first woman president and liked it so much, you did it again; and the politics of Northern Ireland would be better for a few more women in prominent positions too.\n","And you see, I hope, a Britain emerging from its post-Empire malaise, modernizing, becoming as confident of its future as it once was of its past.\n","The program of the new Labour government: driving up standards in education; welfare reform; monetary and fiscal stability as the foundation of a modern economy; massive investment in our public services tied to the challenge of modernization; a huge program of constitutional change; a new positive attitude to Europe -- it is a program of national renewal as ambitious as any undertaken in any western democracy in recent times.\n","It is precisely the dramatic changes in both countries that allow us to see the possibilities of change in our relationship with each other.\n","It will require vision, but no more than the vision that has transformed Ireland. It will require imagination, but no more than that shown by the British people in the last two years. The old ways are changing between London and Dublin. And this can spur the change and healing in Northern Ireland too. The old notions of unionist supremacy and of narrow nationalism are gradually having their fingers prised from their grip on the future.\n","Different traditions have to understand each other. Just as we must understand your yearning for a united Ireland, so too must you understand what the best of unionism is about. They are good and decent people, just like you. They want to remain part of the UK -- and I have made it clear that I value that wish. They feel threatened. Threatened by the terrorism with which they have had to live for so long. Threatened, until the Good Friday Agreement, that they would be forced into a united Ireland against the will of the people of Northern Ireland.\n","Yet they realize now that a framework in which consent is guaranteed is also one in which basic rights of equality and justice are guaranteed, and that those who wish a united Ireland are free to make that claim, provided it is democratically expressed, just as those who believe in the Union can make their claim.\n","It is all about belonging. The wish of unionists to belong to the UK. The wish of nationalists to belong to Ireland. Both traditions are reasonable. There are no absolutes. The beginning of understanding is to realize that.\n","My point is very simple. Those urges to belong, divergent as they are, can live together more easily if we, Britain and the Irish Republic, can live closer together too.\n","Down through the centuries, Ireland and Britain have inflicted too much pain, each on the other. But now, the UK and Ireland as two modern countries, we can try to put our histories behind us, try to forgive and forget those age-old enmities.\n","We have both grown up now. A new generation is in power in each country.\n","We now have a real opportunity to put our relations on a completely new footing, not least through working together in Europe. I know that is what our peoples want and I believe we can deliver it.\n","Our ties are already rich and diverse: -- the UK is the largest market for Irish goods. And you are our fifth most important market in the world;\n","· in trade unions, professional bodies and the voluntary sector, our people work together to help their communities; in culture, sport and academic life there is an enormous crossover. Our theatres are full of Irish plays. Our television is full of Irish actors and presenters. Your national football team has a few English accents too;\n","· above all, at the personal level, millions of Irish people live and work in Britain, and hundreds of thousands of us visit you every year.\n","As ties strengthen, so the past can be put behind us. Nowhere was this better illustrated than at the remarkable ceremony at Messines earlier this month. Representatives of nationalists and unionists traveled together to Flanders to remember shared suffering. Our army bands played together. Our heads of state stood together. With our other European neighbors, such a ceremony would be commonplace. For us it was a first. It shows how far we have come. But it also shows we still have far to go.\n","The relationships across these islands are also changing in a significant way.\n","The Taoiseach has spoken of the exciting new relationships that will unfold as the people of Scotland and Wales, as well as Northern Ireland, express their wishes through their own parliaments and assemblies. The new British Irish Council must reflect and explore these opportunities. We have much to gain by co-operating better across these islands in areas like transport, education, the fight against illegal drugs.\n","But I want our co-operation to be wider and more fundamental still -- above all in Europe.\n","It is 25 years since we both joined what was then the EEC. We have had different approaches to agriculture, to monetary union, to defense. But increasingly we share a common agenda and common objectives:\n","· completion of the Single Market and structural economic reform;\n","· better conditions for growth and jobs in Europe;\n","· successful enlargement;\n","· a united and coherent foreign policy voice for Europe;\n","· a more effective fight against crime, drugs, illegal immigration and environmental damage;\n","· flexible, open and accountable European institutions.\n","We must work to make the single currency a success. Unlike Ireland, we are not joining in the first wave. But we have made clear that we are prepared to join later if the economic benefits are clear and unambiguous. For my government, there is no political or constitutional barrier to joining. There is no resistance to fullhearted European co-operation wherever this brings added value to us all.\n","Enlargement will increasingly test our political and economic imaginations, as we struggle with policy reform and future financing. The international financial system must be reformed. We must learn to apply real political will and harness our skills and resources far more effectively to solve regional problems -- notably in the Balkans and the Middle East. Above all, Europe must restate its vision for today's world, so that our people understand why it is so important. This means defining the priorities where common European action makes obvious sense and can make a real difference, like economic co-ordination, foreign and security policy, the environment, crime and drugs. It also means distinguishing them from areas where countries or regions can best continue to make policy themselves, to suit local circumstances, while still learning from each other -- for example, tax, education, health, welfare.\n","That is why I want to forge new bonds with Dublin. Together we can have a stronger voice in Europe and work to shape its future in a way which suits all our people. It is said there was a time when Irish diplomats in Europe spoke French in meetings to ensure they were clearly distinguished from us. I hope those days are long behind us. We can accomplish much more when our voices speak in harmony.\n","Our ministers and officials are increasingly consulting and coordinating systematically. We can do more. I believe we can transform our links if both sides are indeed ready to make the effort. For our part, we are.\n","This must also involve a dramatic new effort in bilateral relations, above all to bring our young generations together. We need new youth and school exchanges, contact through the new University for Industry, better cultural programs in both directions. We need to work much more closely to fight organized crime and drugs. We can do much more to enrich each other's experience in areas like health care and welfare.\n","None of this threatens our separate identities. Co-operation does not mean losing distinctiveness.\n","What the Taoiseach and I seek is a new dimension to our relationships -- a real partnership between governments and peoples, which will engage our societies at every level.\n","We have therefore agreed to launch a new intensive process. The Taoiseach and I will meet again next spring in London, with key ministerial colleagues, to give this the necessary impetus and agenda, and will thereafter meet at least once a year to review progress. This will be part of the work of the new Intergovernmental Conference. The objective is threefold:\n","First, revitalized and modernized bilateral relations where we can finally put the burden of history behind us;\n","Second, a habit of close consultation on European issues, marked by a step-change in contacts at every level, particularly in key areas such as agriculture, justice and home affairs, employment and foreign and security policy;\n","Third, working together on international issues more widely, for example UN peacekeeping, to which both our countries have been important contributors, arms proliferation and the Middle East.\n","What I welcome above all is that, after keeping us apart for so long, Northern Ireland is now helping to bring us closer together. But I do not believe Northern Ireland can or should any longer define the relationship between us. Our common interests, what we can achieve together, go much, much wider than that.\n","Our two countries can look to the future with confidence in our separate ways. But we will be stronger and more prosperous working together.\n","That is my ambition. I know it is shared by the Taoiseach. I believe it is an ambition shared by both our nations. The 21st century awaits us. Let us confront its challenge with confidence, and together give our children the future they deserve. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," eric liu: iraq, the u.s. and europe are irredeemably linked. he says the monastic traditions of medieval monarchs and feudal chiefs sowed the seeds of later trouble. we were absorbed the same waves of invasions: Celt, Vikings, Normans -- all left their distinctive mark on our countries. --------------------------\n","684 \n","Original text: I believe in this great and beautiful country. I have studied its roots. I have gloried in the wisdom of its magnificent Constitution, and its inimitable history. I have marveled at the wisdom of its founders and its framers. Generation after generation of Americans has understood the lofty ideals that underlie our great Republic. I have been inspired by the story of their sacrifice and their strength.\n","But today, I weep for my country. I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America, Madam President, has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us; our word is disputed; our intentions are questioned.\n","Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience, or threaten recrimination. Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to have succeeded in isolating ourselves. We proclaim a new doctrine of preemption which is understood by few and feared by many. We say that the United States has the right to turn its firepower on any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the war on terrorism. We assert that right without the sanction of any international body. As a result, the world has become a much more dangerous place.\n","We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance. We treat UN Security Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity by lifting their heads from the carpet. Valuable alliances are split. After the war has ended, the United States will have to rebuild much more than the country of Iraq. We will have to rebuild America's image around the globe.\n","The case that this Administration tries to make to justify its fixation with war is tainted by charges of falsified documents and circumstantial evidence. We cannot convince the world of the necessity of this war for one simple reason: This is not a war of necessity, but a war of choice.\n","There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11, at least up to this point. The twin towers fell because a world-wide terrorist group, Al Qaeda, with cells in more than 60 nations, struck at our wealth and our influence by turning our own planes into missiles, one of which would likely have slammed into the dome of this beautiful Capitol except for the brave sacrifice of some of the passengers who were on board that plane.\n","The brutality seen on September 11, and in other terrorist attacks we have witnessed around the globe, are the violent and desperate efforts by extremists to stop the daily encroachment of western values upon their cultures. That is what we fight. It is a force not confined to territorial borders. It is a shadowy entity with many faces, many names, and many addresses.\n","But this Administration has directed all of the anger, fear, and grief which emerged from the ashes of the twin towers and the twisted metal of the Pentagon towards a tangible villain, one we can see and hate and attack. And villain he is. But he is the wrong villain. And this is the wrong war. If we attack Saddam Hussein, we will probably drive him from power. But the zeal of our friends to assist our global war on terrorism may have already taken flight.\n","The general unease surrounding this war is not just [due] to \"orange alert.\" There is a pervasive sense of rush and risk and too many questions unanswered. How long will we be in Iraq? What will be the cost? What is the ultimate mission? How great is the danger here at home? A pall has fallen over the Senate Chamber. We avoid our solemn duty to debate the one topic on the minds of all Americans, even while scores of thousands of our sons and daughters faithfully do their duty in Iraq.\n","Why can this President not seem to see that America's true power lies not in its will to intimidate, but in its ability to inspire?\n","War appears inevitable. But I continue to hope that the cloud will lift. Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run. Perhaps reason will somehow still prevail. I, along with millions -- scores of millions -- of Americans, will pray, pray, pray for the safety of our troops, for the innocent civilians -- women, children, babies, old and young, crippled, deformed, sick -- in Iraq, and for the security of our homeland.\n","May God continue to bless the United States of America in the troubled days ahead, and may we somehow recapture the vision which for the present eludes us.\n","Audio Note: AR-XE = American Rhetoric Extreme Enhancement \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the image of America, Madam President, has changed. we proclaim a new doctrine of preemption which is understood by few and feared by many. the united states has the right to turn its firepower on any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the war on terrorism. --------------------------\n","685 \n","Original text: I wish to make a Ministerial Statement informing the House of a state of national emergency, and the country moving to Alert Level 4.\n","This is to manage the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic within New Zealand.\n","The Minister of Civil Defence took this step because of the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic; and because he considered the response required to combat COVID-19 is of such a degree that it will be beyond the capacity of local Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups to respond to it on their own.\n","This pandemic also requires a significant and coordinated response by and across central and local government.\n","This Epidemic Notice came into effect today, the 25th of March 2020, just after midnight. And it will remain for three months with ongoing review, and from which, now, further Epidemic Management Notices and Epidemic Modification Orders can be given -- particularly across local government, immigration, and social services, crucial services that now need flexibility to operate due to the effects of an epidemic in our country and an impending shutdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n","The trigger: early evidence of community transmission of COVID-19 in New Zealand. But unlike so many other gravely inundated countries, we have a window of opportunity to stay home, break the chain of transmission, and save lives. It’s that simple.\n","In this fight against a virus, we have some things on our side.\n","We are moving into this next phase of our response early -- ahead of any potential over-run of our hospitals; ahead of any deaths on New Zealand soil. But that does not mean we should be complacent. And that’s why we must take this period of self-isolation deadly seriously.\n","This means we will go about life very differently to help slow down the spread of COVID-19, and in that we all have a role to play. Only those in essential services will leave home to go to work. All others stay home and stop interactions with those outside the home.\n","- Non-essential business premises close. - Events and gatherings are cancelled. - Schools close. - Public transport is reserved for those undertaking essential services and transport of freight. - Domestic air travel is very limited. - New Zealanders entering at our borders undergo strict measures to isolate or quarantine.\n","From midnight tonight, we bunker down for four weeks to try and stop the virus in its tracks, and to try to break the chain. Make no mistake: This will get worse before it gets better. We will have a lag and cases will increase for the next week -- or actually more, Mr. Speaker. Then we’ll begin to know how successful we have been.\n","I am fully aware that we have moved with huge speed. No other country in the world has moved to these measures with no deaths and infections at their level that we have. We currently have five people in our hospitals, none in ICUs or needing ventilators at this stage.\n","But we have no time to waste. We could have waited to plan every intricate detail required to execute this closure, till we could answer every single question or circumstance. But every hour we wait is one more person, two more people, three more people, exposed to Covid-19. That is why we did not wait. We established an alert system with clear guidance on when we must act, and why. We asked people to prepare, and then moved decisively.\n","These moves will be enforced. And we will be the enforcer.\n","Yesterday, I issued the Epidemic Notice and today the Minister of Civil Defence declared a State of National Emergency, both of which provide us the powers for Government to move the country to [Alert] Level 4.\n","This is the second time in New Zealand’s history that a State of National Emergency has been declared. The first was on February the 23rd, 2011. It followed the 6.3 magnitude earthquake in Christchurch. It followed the death of many New Zealanders, the total destruction of much infrastructure, and the crippling of essential services.\n","It was declared to allow the greatest possible coordination of local, national, and international resources to work on these -- on rescue and recovery. (I acknowledge Members on the other side of their House will know well...the magnitude of that declaration at that time.)\n","Today we put in place our country’s second State of National Emergency as we fight a global pandemic, as we fight to save New Zealanders’ lives; to prevent the very worst that we’ve seen in other countries around the world from happening here; to protect our essential health services; to cushion the economic impacts of COVID-19.\n","A State of National Emergency to preserve our way of life.\n","Every person still at work, interacting with others, increases the risk of the virus spreading exponentially and means we could be in lockdown for longer. That means people will be out of work for longer, doing further damage to livelihood and lives. There will be no tolerance for that. We will not hesitate to use our enforcement powers if needed.\n","Through the early and hard measures we’ve taken at the border, using the powers under the Health Act, the signing of epidemic notices, now, being in a State of National Emergency, we have all of the legislative means possible, all the enforcement powers, all the tools we need to combat COVID-19.\n","Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, today’s declaration of a State of National Emergency will allow the Director Civil Defence Emergency Management to direct, coordinate, and use the resources made available to manage and respond to COVID-19.\n","The Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management may also control the exercise and performance of functions, duties, and powers of Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups and Group Controllers across the country. While in force, it will allow Controllers to provide for:\n","- conservation and supply of food, fuel, and [other] essential supplies; - regulate land, water, and air traffic; - to close roads and public places; - to evacuate any premises, including any public place; - and, if necessary, to exclude people or vehicles from any premises or place.\n","Those are the powers that sit alongside this declaration. This declaration helps us limit our exposure, and the exposure of the most vulnerable members of [our community, to COVID-19.\n","An Epidemic Notice further strengthens our response. It does a number of things, including allowing for special powers for medical officers of health, and immediately unlocks powers under the Corrections, Health, and Electoral Acts.\n","But importantly, an Epidemic Notice sits as an umbrella over further notices that can now be issued, and which have now been issued, to change and modify specific parts of legislation in a common sense and pragmatic way to keep our systems working in a time of shutdown -- and get rid of particular requirements that are impracticable to comply with [in] a time of an epidemic and when in lockdown.\n","Specifically, that means for our immigration sector:\n","- Temporary visas are automatically extended to late September. This comes into effect from Thursday the 2nd of April, 2020, and means travelers with a temporary work, student, visitor, interim, and limited, visa expiring before 1 April, 2020, who are unable to leave New Zealand must apply online for a new visa, and an interim visa will be issued.\n","- Travelers with a temporary visa due to expire between 1 April and 9 July, 2020, will have their visas extended to late September. Confirmation of extensions will be emailed directly to all visa holders.\n","Detailed information is on the Immigration New Zealand website and covid19.govt.nz. But anyone concerned about their visa should contact Immigration New Zealand.\n","For our social service sector, an epidemic notice means:\n","- The Ministry for Social Development can grant emergency benefits to people who would otherwise not be entitled to them (including temporary workers who lose a job). This sits as a necessary partner to the Government’s multi-billion dollar economic assistan[ce] package that aims to keep people in jobs and with an income, including wage subsidies for all workers working legally in New Zealand and redeployment packages to be utilized post this period, Mr. Speaker.\n","- It also allows for extra flexibility in relation to the payment, reinstatement, grant, increase, cancellation, suspension, or variation of benefits.\n","These notices and the powers which they carry are not issued lightly. The restrictions in place on New Zealanders’ movements are the most significant in our modern history. I do not underestimate the gravity of what is being asked of you, of everyone. But we have a limited window of opportunity.\n","New Zealanders want to see that these measures are being complied with but in a way that we’re used to seeing as New Zealanders. As Police Commissioner Mike Bush said, the Police and the Military will be working together and there is assistance at the ready if required. If people do not follow the messages here today, then the police will remind people of their obligations. They have the ability to escalate if required. They can arrest if needed. They can detain if needed.\n","Speaker of the House: I -- I can see the Prime Minister has got a little way to go. In these matters I am the sole judge of time and what I am indicating to the House is both for the Prime Minster and the Leader of the Opposition: I'm not watching the clock.\n","PM Ardern: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will now summarize. These are all tools of last resort, at a time when I know New Zealanders will rally -- because that is what we do.\n","And so, as we enter into a stage that none of us have experienced before, I want to share a few final messages:\n","- And finally, if you have any questions about what you can or cannot do during this period, apply a simple principle: Act like you have COVID-19. Every move you then make is a risk to someone else. That is how we all must collectively think from now on. That’s why the joy of physically visiting other family, children, grandchildren, friends, neighbors -- for many, that is on hold now, because we’re all now putting each other first. And that is what we do so well as a nation.\n","So, New Zealand: be calm, be kind, stay at home, and break the chain. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the minister of civil defence took this step because of the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. he considered the response required to combat COVID-19 will be beyond the capacity of local Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups to respond to it on their own. the epidemic also requires a significant and coordinated response by and across central and local government. --------------------------\n","686 \n","Original text: I would like to start off by saying thank you to Susan Sarandon not just for the anointing and the words she has just spoken but because she has been so much in the lives of those who need the human heart and the human spirit to be in the midst of their struggle to better themselves.\n","And I'd like to thank Chris Rock for bringing humor into the moment.\n","And I'd like to also thank all of you who are here this evening: my very good friends and very close friends who have turned out to be in support; and all the rest of you whom I don't know intimately but have felt your presence in my life because I've seen your art, I've seen your work, I've seen your poetry, and I've been inspired by much.\n","So thank you fall all this.

The power of moving pictures to impact on human behavior was never more powerfully evidenced than when, after the release of this film, American citizens went on a murderous rampage. Races were set one against the other. Fire and violence erupted. Baseball bats and billy clubs bashed heads. Blood flowed in streets of our cities; and lives were lost.\n","1935, at the age of eight, sitting in a Harlem theater, I watched in awe and wonder the incredible feats of the white superhero, Tarzan of the Apes. Tarzan was a sight to see. This porcelain Adonis, this white liberator, who could speak no language, swinging from tree to tree, saving Africa from the tragedy of destruction by a black indigenous population of inept, ignorant, void-of-any-skills population governed by ancient superstitions, with no heart for Christian charity.\n","Through this film, the virus of racial inferiority, of never wanting to be identified with anything African, swept into the psyche of its youthful observers. And for the years that followed, Hollywood brought abundant opportunity for black children in their Harlem theaters to cheer Tarzan and boo Africans.\n","Native American[s], our Indian brothers and sisters, fared no better. And at the moment, Arabs ain't lookin' so good.\n","But these encounters set other things in motion. It was an early stimulus to the beginning of my rebellion, rebellion against injustice and human distortion, and hate. How fortunate for me that the performing arts became the catalyst that fueled my desire for social change. In its pursuit, I came upon fellow artists like the great actor and my hero, singer-humanist Paul Robeson, painter Charles White, dancer Katherine Dunham, [the] historian’s superior academic mind Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois, social strategist and educator Eleanor Roosevelt, writers Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou and James Baldwin. They all inspired me. They excited me, deeply influenced me, and they were also my moral compass.\n","It was Robeson who said, as you heard in the film earlier, \"Artists are the gatekeepers of truth. They are civilization's radical voice.\" This Robeson environment sounded like a desired place to be, and given the opportunity to dwell there has never disappointed me.\n","For my life of activism and commitment to social change, the opposition has been fiercely punitive. Some who've controlled institutions of culture and commentary have at times used their power to not only distort truth but to punish the truth-seekers. With interventions like McCarthyism and the blacklist, Hollywood, too, has sadly played its part in these tragic scenarios. And on occasion, I have been one of its targets.\n","However, from the cultural environment that gave us all these -- all this social drama and all those movies -- Birth of a Nation, Tarzan of the Apes, Song of the South, to name but a few -- today's cultural harvest yields a sweeter fruit: Defiant Ones, Schindler’s List, Brokeback Mountain, 12 Years a Slave, and many more; and all of this happening at the dawning of technological creations that would give artists boundless regions of possibilities to give us deeper insights into human existence.\n","How fortunate for me that I have lived long enough for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to have chosen to bestow this honor upon me. Tonight is no casual encounter for me. Along with the trophy of honor, there's another layer that gives this journey this kind of wonderful Hollywood ending. To be rewarded by my peers for my work for human rights and civil rights and for peace -- well, let me put this way: It powerfully mutes the enemy's thunder.\n","[Mr. Belafonte addresses Mr. Poitier directly:] Come on, daddy, one more step.\n","I thank the Academy and its Board of Governors for this honor, for this recognition.\n","I really wish I could be around for the rest of this century to see what Hollywood does with the rest of the century. Maybe, just maybe, it could be civilization’s game changer. After all, Paul Robeson said, \"Artists are the radical voice of civilization.\"\n","Each and every one of you in this room, with your gifts and your power and your skills, could perhaps change the way in which our global humanity mistrusts itself.\n","Perhaps we, as artists and as visionaries for what's better in the human heart and the human soul, could you influence citizens everywhere in the world to see the better side of who and what we are as a speci[es].\n","I thank each and every one of you for this honor. And to my fellow honorees, I could have had no better company than to have shared this evening with each of you.\n","Thank you very much. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," america's come a long way since Hollywood in 1915 gave the world the film Birth of 'a Nation' the movie was considered the greatest film ever made. the power of moving pictures to impact on human behavior was never more powerfully evidenced than when american citizens went on murderous rampage after the release of this film - the virus of racism swept into the psyche of its youthful observers, and for the years that followed, Hollywood brought abundant opportunity --------------------------\n","687 \n","Original text: Tomorrow marks [one] hundred days since W-H-O was notified of the first cases of \"pneumonia with unknown cause\" from China. It's incredible to reflect on how dramatically the world has changed in such a short period of time. Today I would like to give an overview of what W-H-O has done in the past [one] hundred days, and what we will be doing in the near future to alleviate suffering and save lives.\n","On the 1st of January, just hours after we were notified of the first cases, W-H-O activated its Incident Management Support Team to coordinate our response at headquarters, regional and country level.\n","On the 5th of January, W-H-O officially notified all Member States of this new outbreak, and published a disease outbreak news on our website.\n","On the 10th of January, we issued a comprehensive package of guidance to countries on how to detect, test, and manage potential cases, and protect health workers. On the same day, we convened our strategic and technical advisory group on infectious hazards to review the situation. We have been engaging with journalists since the beginning, responding to media enquiries around the clock.\n","We convened the emergency committee on the 22nd of January, and again a week later, after the first cases of human-to-human transmission were reported outside China, and declared a public health emergency of international concern -- our highest level of alarm. At the time there were 98 cases outside China and no deaths.\n","In February, an international team of experts from Canada, China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, Singapore, and the United States of America visited affected provinces in China to learn more about the virus, the outbreak and the response, and to glean lessons for the rest of the world.\n","In early February, the United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated, after we discussed with Secretary General António Guterres, to coordinate the entire machinery of the UN to support countries as effectively as possible.\n","Since then, we have been working day and night in five key areas.\n","First: We have worked to support countries in building their capacity to prepare and respond. Through W-H-O's network of six regional offices and 150 country offices, we have worked closely with governments around the world to prepare their health systems for COVID-19, and to respond when cases arrive. We issued a Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which identified the major actions countries need to take and the resources needed to carry them out. Governments and partners rose to the challenge. More than 800 million (US) dollars has been pledged or received for the response. That includes more than 140 million (US) dollars from more than 229,000 individuals and organizations raised through the Solidarity Response Fund, exceeding all our expectations, and showing the true solidarity globally.\n","I would like to thank all donors for their support, including Apple for its contribution of 10 million U.S. dollars. To ensure this money is used where it's needed most, we have set up an online portal to help partners match needed -- needs with funds.\n","We activated our global expert networks to tap the world's leading epidemiologists, clinicians, social-scientists, statisticians, virologists, risk communicators, and others, to make our response truly global and to capture all the support we need from all over the world, from W-H[-O] experts and from other experts in many of the institutions we have globally.\n","Our EPI-WIN team has adapted our advice for individuals and communities, health workers, employers and workers, faith-based organizations, and more about how to protect themselves and others.\n","Through our daily situation reports and these regular press briefings, we have kept -- kept the world informed about the latest data, information, and evidence.\n","We have held regular briefings with our Member States, to answer their questions and learn from their experiences.\n","The WhatsApp chatbot now has more than 12 million followers and is available in 7 languages, including Hindi and Portuguese, which are launching today. The Viber chatbot has more than 2 million followers, in three languages and four more to launch next week, reaching out to the citizens of the world, the person in the street, informing them about the latest information we have.\n","Just in the past two days we convened an online workshop to crowdsource ideas from over 600 experts, institutions, and individuals on ways to combat the infodemic.\n","We have worked with FIFA and some of the world's biggest sports stars to promote clean hands and physical activity.\n","And since we announced the One World: Together at Home concert with Lady Gaga and Global Citizen on Monday, more TV networks and online platforms from around the world have contacted us offering the broadcast -- to broadcast the concert. And Lady Gaga had already raised 35 million US dollars [as she informed us] during our conference with her.\n","Third: We're working hard to ensure supplies of essential medical equipment for frontline health workers. So far, we have shipped more than two million items of personal protective equipment to 133 countries, and we're preparing to ship another two million items in the coming weeks. We have sent more than one million diagnostic tests to 126 countries, in all regions, and we are sourcing more.\n","But we know much more is needed. This is not enough. So we're working with the International Chamber of Commerce, the World Economic Forum and others in the private sector to ramp up the production and distribution of essential medical supplies.\n","Fourth: We're working to train and mobilize health workers. More than 1.2 million people have enrolled in 6 courses in 43 languages on our OpenWHO.org platform. Our target is to train tens of millions, and we have all the readiness to train tens of millions, hundreds of millions. Experts have been deployed around the world through W-H-O's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and our Emergency Medical Teams platform. And Fifth: We have accelerated research and development. In February -- early February, we brought more than 400 of the world's leading researchers together to identify and accelerate research priorities. We launched the Solidarity Trial, with more than 90 countries globally working together to find effective therapeutics as soon as possible.\n","To better understand the transmission, epidemiology, and clinical features of the virus, we have developed research protocols that are being used in more than 40 countries, in a coordinated way. We're working with FIND [Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics] to accelerate development and access to diagnostics. Today, 130 scientists, funders, and manufacturers from around the world have signed a statement committing to work with W-H-O to speed the development of a vaccine against COVID-19.\n","Of course, W-H-O is not alone. [The] UN is not alone. Every day, we work with thousands of partners in the government, academia, the private sector, civil society, and more.\n","There are many, many other things W-H-O has done in the past hundred days that I haven't mentioned.\n","In the coming days, W-H-O will be releasing an updated strategy, and a revised Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, with an estimate of the financial needs for the next phase of the response.\n","Throughout, our focus has been on working with countries and with partners to bring the world together to confront this common threat together. We're especially concerned with protecting the world's poorest and most vulnerable, not just in the poorest countries, but in all countries.\n","For the past hundred days, our unwavering commitment has been to serve all people of the world with equity, objectivity, and neutrality. And that will continue to be our sole focus in the days, weeks, and months ahead.\n","Finally, this is a special time of year for Christians, Jews, and Muslims around the world. Today, W-H-O has published practical considerations and recommendations for faith-based communities. We know that COVID-19 means billions of believers are not able to celebrate in the way they usually would.\n","But we wish everyone a safe and joyful Easter, Passover, and Ramadan.\n","Thank you.\n","Original Text Source: WHO.int\n","Original Audio Source: https://who.canto.global\n","Original Image Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2019-nCoV-CDC-23312_without_background.png\n","Audio Note: AR-XE = American Rhetoric Extreme Enhancement\n","See also: CDC Latest Data and Recommendations \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," today marks the 100th anniversary of the first cases of \"pneumonia with unknown cause\" from china. the world has changed in such a short period of time, and we will be doing in the near future to alleviate suffering and save lives. on the 1st of January, W-H-O activated its Incident Management Support Team to coordinate our response at headquarters, regional and country level. --------------------------\n","688 \n","Original text: Thank you, Frank. Thank you to Frank Ricciardone. Thank you for your service to America as well, in addition to the duties that you perform here.\n","I've had the good fortune to be a frequent visitor here to Egypt and the Middle East as Secretary of State. In my prior role as CIA director, I was here with some frequency, and I came here too as a member of Congress. Every time I come, I get to see something new, something wonderful.\n","This trip is especially meaningful for me as an evangelical Christian, coming so soon after the Coptic Church's Christmas celebrations. This is an important time. We're all children of Abraham: Christians, Muslims, Jews. In my office, I keep a Bible open on my desk to remind me of God and His Word, and The Truth.\n","And it's the truth, lower-case \"t,\" that I'm here to talk about today. It is a truth that isn't often spoken in this part of the world, but because I'm a military man by training, I'll be very blunt and direct today: America is a force for good in the Middle East.\n","We need to acknowledge that truth, because if we don't, we make bad choices -- now and in the future. And our choices, the choices we make today have consequences for nations, and for millions and millions of people, for our safety, for our economic prosperity, for our personal freedoms, and those of our children.\n","And there's no more appropriate place than where I'm standing today to have this discussion at the American University here in beautiful Cairo. As Frank said, this year marks 100 years since the founding of this institution, and the AUC is more than just a university. It is an important symbol of America's friendship with Egypt and what binds our people together. Together, we've created a modern place of learning in the midst of an ancient civilization with its own rich history of artists, poets, and intellectuals.\n","Egypt has always been a land of striving. And yet at times, your aspirations and those of your brethren in the Middle East have seemed impossible to achieve. These lands witnessed convulsions from Tunis to Tehran as old systems crumbled and new ones struggled to emerge. That's happened here, too.\n","And at this critical moment, America, your long-time friend, was absent too much. Why? Because our leaders gravely misread our history, and your historical moment. These fundamental misunderstandings, set forth in this city in 2009, adversely affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Egypt and all across the region.\n","He told you that radical Islamist terrorism does not stem from an ideology.\n","He told you that 9/11 led my country to abandon its ideals, particularly in the Middle East.\n","He told you that the United States and the Muslim world needed (quote), \"a new beginning,\" (end of quote).\n","The results of these misjudgments have been dire.\n","In falsely seeing ourselves as a force for what ails the Middle East, we were timid in asserting ourselves when the times -- and our partners -- demanded it.\n","We grossly underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism, a debauched strain of the faith that seeks to upend every other form of worship or governance. ISIS drove to the outskirts of Baghdad as America hesitated. They raped and pillaged and murdered tens of thousands of innocents. They birthed a caliphate across Syria and Iraq and launched terror attacks that killed all across continents.\n","America's reluctance, our reluctance, to wield our influence kept us silent as the people of Iran rose up against the mullahs in Tehran in the Green Revolution. The ayatollahs and their henchmen murdered, jailed, and intimidated freedom-loving Iranians, and they wrongly blamed America for this unrest when it was their own tyranny that had fueled it. Emboldened, the regime spread its cancerous influence to Yemen, to Iraq, to Syria, and still further into Lebanon.\n","Our penchant, America's penchant, for wishful thinking led us to look the other way as Hezbollah, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian regime, accumulated a massive arsenal of approximately 130,000 rockets and missiles. They stored and positioned these weapons in Lebanese towns and villages in flagrant violation of international law. That arsenal is aimed squarely at our ally Israel.\n","When Bashar Assad unleashed terror upon ordinary Syrians and barrel-bombed civilians with sarin gas, a true echo of Saddam Hussein's gassing of the Kurdish people, we condemned his actions. But in our hesitation to wield power, we did nothing.\n","Our eagerness to address only Muslims and not nations ignored the rich diversity of the Middle East and frayed old bonds. It undermined the concept of the nation-state, the building block of international stability. And our desire for peace at any cost led us to strike a deal with Iran, our common enemy.\n","So today, what did we learn from all of this? We learned that when America retreats, chaos often follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. And when we partner with enemies, they advance.\n","The good news. The good news is this: The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering. Now comes the real new beginning.\n","In just 24 months, actually less than two years, the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region. We've learned from our mistakes. We've rediscovered our voice. We've rebuilt our relationships. We've rejected false overtures from our enemies.\n","President Sisi joined us. He joined us in denouncing the twisted ideology which has brought death and suffering on so many. I thank President Sisi for his courage.\n","As I said in a recent speech that I gave in Brussels, our words mean something again, and they should. West Point taught me a basic code of integrity. If we commit American prestige to an action, our allies depend on us to follow through.\n","The Trump Administration did not stand idly by when Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against his people. Indeed, President Trump unleashed the fury of the U.S. military not once, but twice, with allied support. And he's willing to do it again, although we do hope that he does not have to.\n","For those who fret about the use of American power, remember this: America has always been, and always will be, a liberating force, not an occupying power. We've never dreamed of domination in the Middle East. Can you say the same about Iran?\n","In World War II, American GIs helped free North [Africa] from Nazi occupation. Fifty years later, we assembled a coalition to liberate Kuwait from Saddam Hussein. Would the Russians or Chinese come to your rescue in the same way, the way that we have?\n","And when the mission is over, when the job is complete, America leaves. Today in Iraq, at the government's invitation, we have approximately 5,000 troops where there were once 166,000. We once had tens of thousands of U.S. military stationed -- personnel stationed in Saudi Arabia. Now that number is a tiny fraction. When we do set up major bases, as we've done in Bahrain, in Kuwait, in Qatar, and in Turkey and the Emirates, it's at the invitation of the host country.\n","In that same spirit, just last year, America bolstered a coalition of allies and partners to dismantle the Islamic State's caliphate, liberating Iraqis, Syrians, Arabs and Kurds, Muslims and Christians, men, women, and children. President Trump empowered our commanders in the field to strike ISIS quicker and harder than ever before. And now 99 percent of the territory ISIS once held is liberated. Life is returning to normal for millions of Iraqis and Syrians. Nations in the global coalition should all be enormously proud of this achievement. Together we have saved thousands of lives.\n","Our allies and partners have helped greatly in the counter-ISIS effort. France and Britain joined our strikes on Syria and have supported our anti-terror effort around the world. Jordan and Turkey have hosted millions of Syrians fleeing violence. Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries have generously contributed towards stabilization efforts. We thank all of them for their help, and we urge them to continue.\n","The United States has also helped liberated areas as an important means of preventing the caliphate from re-emerging. We have provided 2.5 billion dollars in humanitarian assistance to Iraq since 2014, and our churches and non-profits do good work there every day as well. We and our allies generated nearly 30 billion in grants and financing support to aid Iraq's reconstruction during the Kuwait Reconstruction Conference just this past year.\n","Think about the people we're helping. Last year, I hosted the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom in Washington. At that conference, our ambassador-at-large recounted his trip to Iraq. There he met Yezidi women who had been sold into bondage, whose children had been ripped out of their arms. Life under ISIS was real hell, a living hell on Earth. Today, those areas are liberated, thanks to our coalition's power and might and commitment.\n","I recall a line from your late Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz. Quote: \"Good is achieving victory every day. It may even be that Evil is weaker than we imagine.\"\n","Let's turn to Iran.\n","President Trump has reversed our willful blindness to the danger of the regime and withdrew from the failed nuclear deal, with its false promises. The U.S. re-imposed sanctions that should never have been lifted. We embarked on a new pressure campaign to cut off the revenues the regime uses to spread terror and destruction throughout the world. We joined the Iranian people in calling for freedom and accountability.\n","And importantly, we fostered a common understanding with our allies of the need to counteract the Iran regime's revolutionary agenda. Countries increasingly understand that we must confront the ayatollahs, not coddle them. Nations are rallying to our side to confront the regime like never before. Egypt, Oman, Kuwait, and Jordan have all been instrumental in thwarting Iran's efforts to evade sanctions.\n","The UAE has canceled its imports of Iranian condensate following the re-imposition of American sanctions. Bahrain has exposed the Revolutionary Guard proxies that are active in its country, and which -- and working -- is working to stop Iran's illicit maritime activities in its region. Saudi Arabia, too, has worked with us to counter Iranian expansion and regional influence. We, the United States, commend each of these efforts, and we seek for all nations to continue the work to constrain the full array of the regime's malign activity.\n","The work to curb the regime's deadly ambitions isn't confined to the Middle East. America's friends and partners from South Korea to Poland have joined our effort to stop Iran's wave of regional destruction and global campaigns of terror.\n","Countries across the globe have cut Iranian oil imports to zero and are working towards that goal. Private companies in France, Germany, Britain and elsewhere have all calculated that enriching themselves through work with the regime is bad for business and bad for the people of their own countries.\n","In Yemen, we've assisted our coalition partners as they take the lead in preventing an Iranian expansion that would be disastrous for world trade and regional security. As is always the case with America, our engagement has also been coupled with robust humanitarian aid. We've supported the UN talks to put Yemen on the path to peace.\n","In Lebanon, Hezbollah remains a major presence, but we won't accept this status quo. Our aggressive sanctions campaign against Iran is also directed at the terror group and its leaders, including the son of Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah.\n","Now let's talk about America's efforts to build coalition.\n","The Trump Administration has moved quickly to rebuild links amongst our old friends and nurture new partnerships. My very first trip in this job included stops in Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.\n","In fact, after being sworn in as Secretary of State, I visited those countries before I ever went to my office in Washington, D.C. And I welcome your leaders to my office often, as I did with Foreign Minister Shoukry in August of last year.\n","Coalition building for America is natural, but in past years we've neglected it. This administration has enjoyed fruitful relationships in the Middle East for hundreds of years, but we must keep them and work to keep them. Look, our ties stem back a long ways -- with Morocco and Oman, back to 1777 and 1833. And our friendship with the country in which we are today, Egypt, stems back generations. Indeed, this year marks the 70th anniversary of our diplomatic relations with Jordan. We're building out a healthy dialogue with the Government of Iraq, a thriving and young democracy. We're also building relationships for our shared prosperity. It is time for old rivalries to end for the sake of the greater good of the region.\n","The Trump Administration is also working to establish the Middle East Strategic Alliance to confront the region's most serious threat and bolster energy and economic cooperation. This effort is bringing together members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as Egypt and Jordan. Today, we ask each of those countries to take the next step and help us solidify MESA.\n","We're also seeing remarkable change. New bonds are taking root that were unimaginable until very recently. Who could've believed a few years ago that an Israeli prime minister would visit Muscat? Or that new ties would emerge between Saudi Arabia and Iraq? Or that a Roman Catholic pope would visit this city to meet with Muslim imams and the head of the Coptic faith?\n","In October of last year, the Israeli national anthem played as an Israeli judo champion was crowned the winner of a tournament in the United Arab Emirates. It was the first time -- the first time -- that an Israeli delegation was allowed to participate under its own national flag. It was also the first time that an Israeli culture and sports minister attended a sports event in the Gulf. She said, and I quote, \"It is a dream come true. For two years we had talks in order to reach this moment.\" It was hard for her to stop the tears. \"I want to thank the authorities in Abu Dhabi and our hosts here who received us in an exemplary manner.\" She could not have been happier.\n","These steps toward rapprochement are necessary for greater security in the face of our shared threats, and they also hint at a much brighter future for the region.\n","Of course our work together is not finished. It's almost never America's work alone. The U.S. knows that we can't, and shouldn't, fight every fight or sustain every economy. No nation wants to be dependent on another. Our aim -- our aim -- is to partner with our friends and vigorously oppose our enemies, because a strong, secure, and economically vibrant Middle East is in our national interest, and it's in yours as well.\n","Let me be clear: America will not retreat until the terror fight is over. We will labor tirelessly alongside you to defeat ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other jihadists that threaten our security and yours. President Trump has made the decision to bring our troops home from Syria. We always do and now is the time, but this isn't a change of mission. We remain committed to the complete dismantling of ISIS -- the ISIS threat -- and the ongoing fight against radical Islamism in all of its forms. But as President Trump has said, we're looking to our partners to do more, and in this effort we will do so going forward together.\n","For our part, airstrikes in the region will continue as targets arise. We will keep working with our partners in the Coalition to Defeat ISIS. We will continue to hunt down terrorists who seek safe havens in Libya and in Yemen. We strongly support Egypt's efforts to destroy ISIS in the Sinai. We strongly support Israel's efforts to stop Tehran from turning Syria into the next Lebanon.\n","And as the fighting continues, we will continue to assist our partners in efforts to guard borders, prosecute terrorists, screen travelers, assist refugees, and more. But \"assist\" is the key phrase. We ask every peace-loving nation of the Middle East to shoulder new responsibilities for defeating Islamist extremism wherever we find it.\n","It is important to know also that we will not ease our campaign to stop Iran's malevolent influence and actions against this region and the world. The nations of the Middle East will never enjoy security, achieve economic stability, or advance the dreams of their people if Iran's revolutionary regime persists on its current course.\n","February 11th will mark 40 years since the oppressive regime came to power in Tehran. America's economic sanctions against the regime are the strongest in history, and will keep getting tougher until Iran starts behaving like a normal country. The 12 demands that we stated in May remain in force, because the regime's threat to the region endures.\n","In Syria, the United States will use diplomacy and work with our partners to expel every last Iranian boot, and work through the UN-led process to bring peace and stability to the long-suffering Syrian people. There will be no U.S. reconstruction assistance for areas of Syria held by Assad until Iran and its proxy forces withdraw and until we see irreversible progress towards a political resolution.\n","In Lebanon, the United States will work to reduce the threat of Hezbollah's missile arsenal, which is aimed at Israel and can reach all points inside of that country. Many of these rockets are equipped with advance guidance systems, courtesy of Iran, and that's unacceptable. Iran may think it owns Lebanon. Iran is wrong.\n","In Iraq, the United States will help our partners build a nation free of Iranian influence. This past May, Iraqis rejected sectarianism in a national election, and we will support that wholeheartedly. The people there refused to be cowered by Iranian-backed thugs and armed groups. Iraqis have strengthened ties with Arab neighbors, peacefully resumed cooperation between the Kurdish Region and Baghdad, and have renewed their focus on fighting corruption.\n","And in Yemen, we will continue to work for a lasting peace.\n","And I think this is clear, but it is worth reiterating: The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against the Iranian regime's aggressive adventurism. We will continue to ensure that Israel has the military capacity to do so decisively.\n","The Trump Administration will also continue to press for a real and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Again, we've adhered to our word. President Trump campaigned on the promise to recognize Jerusalem -- the seat of Israel's government -- as the nation's capital. In May, we moved our embassy there. These decisions honor a bipartisan congressional resolution from more than two decades ago. President Trump acted on this commitment.\n","The United States also is working to keep our bilateral relationships strong. Over the next few days, I'll hold in-depth discussions with the leaders of Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait. We'll talk about our shared goals, just as I did in Jordan and Iraq this week, and as I did today with President Sisi and Foreign Minister Shoukry.\n","And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas. The progress made to date can continue.\n","I also applaud President Sisi's efforts to promote religious freedom, which stands as an example for all leaders and all peoples of the Middle East. I was happy to see our citizens, wrongly convicted of improperly operating NGOs here, finally be acquitted. And we strongly support President Sisi's initiative to amend Egyptian law so that this does not happen again. More work certainly needs to be done to maximize the potential of the Egyptian nation and its people. I'm glad that America will be a partner in those efforts.\n","Let me close here with a couple of final thoughts.\n","First, it's never easy to recognize truth. But when we see it, we must speak it. America has been criticized for doing too much in the Middle East, and we've been criticized for doing too little. But one thing we've never been is an empire-builder or an oppressor.\n","Just look at our history together, the history which I have recounted today. Look at our fights against common enemies. Look at our coalition building. And finally, just look around you at this university, which has existed now for a century. It's not a coincidence that many other American universities like this one thrive all across the Middle East, from Beirut to Sulaymaniyah. These are symbols of America's innate goodness, of our hopes for you, and of the better future we desire for all nations of the Middle East.\n","I want to thank you all for being here today, and may the good Lord bless each and every one of you.\n","Thank you. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," this year marks 100 years since the founding of this institution, and the AUC is more than just a university. it is an important symbol of America's friendship with Egypt and what binds our people together, says Frank ricciardone - and he says the u.s. needs to acknowledge that truth, because if we don't, we make bad choices -- now and in the future. --------------------------\n","689 \n","Original text: Thank you all. I can't tell you how -- how wonderful that makes me feel. It happens everywhere I go, but it's still special. If you all will indulge me, I learned something, I guess, it's early Friday morning that I didn't know...Friday morning is when I learned this. I learned that Fox, God love them, is televising this speech on the Fox News Channel, which means -- which means, ladies and gentleman, this is my first ever address to the nation. Now, I have someone in back taking phone numbers. In fact -- In fact, I would like to introduce to you my security chief, a man who runs all of my security. His name is Joseph Stalin. Joseph, would you please... I am safe -- I am safe from any liberal attack, in public, because they would be afraid of offending Stalin.\n","Now the opportunity here to address the nation, a serious one, it really is. And I want to take it seriously. I want to address something. I know that people are probably watching this who never have listened to my program and may not even really know what conservatism is. They think they do based on how they've been told -- the way we've been impugned and maligned and so forth. One of the things that is totally erroneous about me -- and I just want to get this up front -- is that I'm pompous. And that I am arrogant. Neither of these things are remotely true. I can tell you a joke to illustrate this. Larry King passed away, goes to heaven. He's greeted by Saint Peter at the gates. Saint Peter says, \"Welcome, Mr. King, it's great to have you here. I want to show you around, give you an idea of what's here, maybe you can pick a place that you'd like to reside.\" King says, \"I just have one question: Is Rush Limbaugh here?\" \"No, he's got a lot of time yet, Mr. King.\" So Saint Peter begins the tour. Larry King sees the various places and it's beyond anything we can imagine in terms of beauty. Finally, he gets to the biggest room of all, with this giant throne. And over the throne is a flashing beautiful angelic neon sign that says \"Rush Limbaugh.\" And Larry King looks at Saint Peter and says: \"I thought you said he wasn't here.\" \"He said, he's not, he's not. This is God's room. He just thinks he's Rush Limbaugh.\" So you see I'm not pompous.\n","Now, seriously, for those of you watching on C-SPAN as well, and on Fox, I want to tell you who we all are in this room. I want to tell you who conservatives are. We conservatives have not done a good enough job of just laying out basically who we are because we make the mistake of assuming people know. What they know is largely incorrect based on the way we are portrayed in pop culture, in the Drive-By Media, by the Democrat Party.\n","Let me tell you who we conservatives are: We love people. When we look out over the United States of America, when we are anywhere, when we see a group of people, such as this or anywhere, we see Americans. We see human beings. We don't see groups. We don't see victims. We don't see people we want to exploit. What we see -- what we see is potential. We do not look out across the country and see the average American, the person that makes this country work. We do not see that person with contempt. We don't think that person doesn't have what it takes. We believe that person can be the best he or she wants to be if certain things are just removed from their path like onerous taxes, regulations and too much government.\n","We want every American to be the best he or she chooses to be. We recognize that we are all individuals. We love and revere our founding documents, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. We believe that the preamble to the Constitution contains an inarguable truth that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life. Liberty, Freedom. And the pursuit of happiness. Those of you watching at home may wonder why this is being applauded. We conservatives think all three are under assault. Thank you. Thank you. We don't want to tell anybody how to live. That's up to you. If you want to make the best of yourself, feel free. If you want to ruin your life, we'll try to stop it -- and make -- but it's a waste. We look over the country as it is today, we see so much waste, human potential that's been destroyed by 50 years of a welfare state. By a failed war on poverty.\n","We love the people of this country. And we want this to be the greatest country it can be, but we do understand, as people created and endowed by our creator, we're all individuals. We resist the effort to group us. We resist the effort to make us feel that we're all the same, that we're no different than anybody else. We're all different. There are no two things or people in this world who are created in a way that they end up with equal outcomes. That's up to them. They are created equal, given the chance -- We don't hate anybody. We don't -- I mean, the racism in this country, if you ask me, I know many people in this audience -- let me deal with this head on. You know what the cliche is, a conservative: racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen of America, if you were paying attention, I know you were, the racism in our culture was exclusively and full on display in the Democrat primary last year.\n","t was not us asking whether Barack Obama was authentic. What we were asking is: Is he wrong? We concluded, yes. We still think so. But we didn't ask if he was authentically black. We didn't say, as some southern Christian leadership conference leaders said: Barack is not authentic, he's not got any slave blood. He's really not down for the struggle, but his wife does. So don't expect the race industry to go away. Southern Christian Leadership Council-- you may not know this, because it wasn't reported in the Drive-By Media -- the racism, the sexism, the bigotry that we're all charged with, just so you across the United States of America know, and you'll see demonstrated here as the afternoon goes on, doesn't exist on our side. We want everybody to succeed. You know why? You know why? We want the country to succeed and for the country to succeed its people, its individuals must succeed. Everyone among us must be pursuing his ambition or her desire, whatever, with excellence. Trying to be the best they can be. Not told, as they are told by the Democrat Party: You really can't do that, you don't have what it takes, besides you're a minority or you're a woman and there are too many people that want to discriminate against you. You can't get anywhere. You need to depend on us. Well. Take a look, someone has to say this -- I am thrilled for the opportunity to say it in my first national address to the nation -- and I'm going to touch on this in more detail in a moment but this is just to get you thinking -- take a look at all the constituency groups that for 50 years have been depending on the Democrat Party to improve their lives. And you tell me if you find any. They're still complaining, still griping about the same problems. Their problems don't get fixed by government. And those lives have been poisoned. Those lives have been cut short by false promises, from government representatives who said don't worry about it, we'll take care of you. Just vote for us.\n","For those of you just tuning in on the Fox News Channel or C-SPAN, I'm Rush Limbaugh and I want everyone in this room and every one of you around the country to succeed. I want anyone who believes in life, liberty, pursuit of happiness to succeed. And I want any force, any person, any element of an overarching big government that would stop your success, I want that organization, that element or that person to fail. I want you to succeed. Also, for those of you in the Drive-By Media watching, I have not needed a teleprompter for anything I've said. And nor do any of us need a teleprompter, because our beliefs are not the result of calculations and contrivances. Our beliefs are not the result of a deranged psychology. Our beliefs are our core. Our beliefs are our hearts. We don't have to make notes about what we believe. We don't have to write down, oh do I believe it do I believe it we can tell people what we believe off the top of our heads and we can do it with passion and we can do it with clarity, and we can do it persuasively. Some of us just haven't had the inspiration or motivation to do so in a number of years, but that's about to change.\n","For example, we gather here -- I understand that. I talked to David and Lisa in the super exclusive private green room that nobody, but about 55 people were allowed into, and they said that there's a sense of liberation here among all of you that are attending CPAC. I understand what the sense of liberation is about. But don't make the mistake at the same time of feeling liberated as thinking we're better and we can do better as a minority. Because we're not a minority. And if you start thinking of yourselves as a minority, you're going to be defensive. And you'll allow the majority to set the agenda and the premise and you're responding to it. The American people may not all vote the way we wish them to, but more Americans than you know live their lives as conservatives in one degree or another. And they are waiting for leadership. We need conservative leadership. We can take this country back. All we need is to nominate the right candidate. It's no more complicated than that.\n","Now, let me speak about President Obama for just a second. President Obama is one of the most gifted politicians, one of the most gifted men that I have ever witnessed. He has extraordinary talents. He has communication skills that hardly anyone can surpass. No, seriously. No, no, I'm being very serious about this. It just breaks my heart that he does not use these extraordinary talents and gifts to motivate and inspire the American people to be the best they can be. He's doing just the opposite. And it's a shame. President Obama has the ability -- he has the ability to inspire excellence in people's pursuits. He has the ability to do all this, yet he pursues a path, seeks a path that punishes achievement, that punishes earners and punishes -- and he speaks negatively of the country. Ronald Reagan used to speak of a shining city on a hill. Barack Obama portrays America as a soup kitchen in some dark night in a corner of America that's very obscure. He's constantly telling the American people that bad times are ahead, worst times are ahead. And it's troubling, because this is the United States of America. Anybody ever ask -- I'm in awe of our country and I ask this question a lot as I've gotten older. We're less than 300 years old. We are younger than nations that have been on this planet for thousands of years. We, nevertheless, in less than 300 years -- by the way, we're no different than any other human beings around the world. Our DNA is no different. We're not better just because we're born in America. There's nothing that sets us apart. How did this happen? How did the United States of America become the world's lone super power, the world's economic engine, the most prosperous opportunity for an advanced lifestyle that humanity has ever known? How did this happen? And why pray tell does the President of the United States want to destroy it? It saddens me. The freedom we spoke of earlier is the freedom, it's the ambition, it's the desire, the wherewithal, the passions that people have that gave us the great entrepreneurial advances, the great inventions, the greatest food production, the human lifestyle advances in this country, why shouldn't that be rewarded? Why is that now the focus of punishment? Why is that now the focus of blame? Why doesn't -- Mayor Bloomberg the other day, ladies and gentlemen, resisting his Governor's call for an increased tax on the rich in New York had some astounding numbers. Eight million people live in New York. 40,000 of those eight million pay roughly 60 to 70% of New York's operating budget. He was afraid that if he raised taxes on those people some of them might leave. Mayor, one already has, by the way. Stop and think of this, though. Stop and think of this. 40,000 people out of eight million. He's right, if 10,000 of them leave, or 5,000, they've got a huge problem. Because New York has its own welfare state inside the one the federal government's created. They've got a dependency class that has grown up and been educated their entitlement is to be fed and taken care of by these evil mean people who have more than they do. If New York City, New York State or Washington, DC were a business, these 40,000 people would be taken on golf tournament trips to Los Angeles, and they would be wined and dined and they would be thanked and they would be encouraged to keep it up. They wouldn't be told they're the problem. They wouldn't be told, except there's -- I pride my accuracy rating. There is one other business where the customer is always wrong and that's the media. Sorry about that.\n","Have you ever called to complain about whatever they do? They say, yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full. They hang up and say you're too stupid to know how they're doing what they're doing. You can't get it. You're not sophisticated enough. So that's another business where the customer is always wrong. But, seriously, the people who have achieved great things, most of it is not inherited. Most wealth in this country is the result of entrepreneurial, just plain old hard work. There's no reason to punish it. There's no reason to raise taxes on these people. Barack Obama, the Democrat Party, have one responsibility, and that's to respect the oath they gave to protect, defend and follow the US Constitution. They don't have the right to take money that's not theirs and none of it is from the back pockets of producers and give it to groups like ACORN which are going to advance the Democrat Party. If anybody but government were doing this, it would be a crime. And many of us think it's bordering on that as it exists now.\n","President Obama is so busy trying to foment and create anger in a created atmosphere of crisis. He is so busy fueling the emotions of class envy that he's forgotten it's not his money that he's spending. In fact, the money he's spending is not ours. He's spending wealth that has yet to be created. And that is not sustainable. It will not work. This has been tried around the world. And every time it's been tried it's a failed disaster. What's the longest war in American history? Did somebody say the war on poverty? Smart group. War on poverty. The war on poverty essentially started in the '30s as part of the New Deal, but it really ramped up in the '60s with Lyndon Johnson, part of the great society war on poverty. We have transferred something like 10 trillion, maybe close to 11 trillion, from producers and earners to nonproducers and earners since 1965. Yet, as I listen to the Democratic Party campaign, why, America is still a soup kitchen, the poor is still poor and they have no hope and they're poor for what reason? They're poor because of us, because we don't care, and because we've gotten rich by taking from them, that's what kids in school are taught today. That's what others have said to the media. You know why they're poor, you know why they remain poor? Because their lives have been destroyed by the never-ending government hay that's designed to help them but it destroys ambition. It destroys the education they might get to learn to be self-fulfilling. And it breaks our heart. It breaks our heart. We lose track of numbers with all of the money, with all the money that's been transferred, redistributed, with all the charitable giving in this country. Ladies and gentlemen, there ought not be any poverty except those who are genuinely ill equipped. But most of the people in poverty in this country are equipped for far much more. They've just been beaten down. They're told don't worry, we'll take care of you. There's nothing out there for you anyway; you'll be discriminated against. Breaks our heart to see this. We can't have a great country and a growing economy with more and more people being told they have a right, because of some injustice that's been done to them or some discrimination, that they have a right to the earnings of others. And it's gotten so out of hand now that what worries me is that this administration, the Barack Obama administration is actively seeking to expand the welfare state in this country because he wants to control it.\n","George Will once asked Dr. Friedrich Von Hayek, tremendous classical liberal economist, great man. 1975, George Will, Dr. Von Hayek, why is it that intellectuals, supposed smartest people in the room, why is it that intellectuals can look right out their windows, their own homes and cars and look at their universities and not see the bounties and the growth and the greatness of capitalism? And von Hayek said: I've troubled over this for years and I've finally concluded that for intellectuals, pseudo intellectuals, and all liberals, it's about control. It's not about raising revenue. You think Obama has any intention of paying for all this spending? Folks, if he had any intention of paying for it, he wouldn't do 90% of it because we don't have the money. They don't care about paying for it. All that's just words. All that's just rhetoric paying for it because he knows you have to worry about paying for it. He knows we all have to be concerned -- oh, except, wrong again. Except the words of Barney Frank and Chris Dodd who were given homes that everybody knew they could never pay for, and now Barney Frank and Chris Dodd the architects along with Bill Clinton of the policy that gave us the whole sub-prime mortgage crisis get to sit around and act as innocent spectators to investigate what went on when they largely had the biggest role in causing it. Congressman Frank's definition of affordable housing is you get a house you don't have to pay for that everybody else in the neighborhood will pay for. Why? Because it's unfair that some people can have a house and some people can't. Geez, it's just unfair. So here we have two systems. We have socialism, collectivism, Stalin, whatever you want to call it, versus capitalism. Admittedly over on the right side capitalism there will be unequal outcomes because we're all different. And some of us care more and have more passion and we know what we want to do and others are still struggling for it. Some people are just going to work harder than others. Okay. You get what you work for. Those who have a genuine inability for whatever reason are taken care of. We're compassionate people. On the left side when you get into this collectivism socialism stuff, these people on the left, the Democrats and liberals today claim that they are pained by the inequities and the inequalities in our society. And they believe that these inequities and inequalities descend from the selfishness and the greed of the achievers. And so they tell the people who are on different income quintiles, whatever lists, they say it's not that you're not working hard enough, you could have what they have, perhaps, if you applied it. They're stealing it from you.\n","So what liberals do, and I say this again to the -- another thing, I know people in the country are watching. I was watching a focus group after some event this week. Might have been after Obama's State of the Union show. And they had -- it was a typical, you know, Drive-By Media focus group. They round up losers -- who hear Obama speak and think that the next day their gas tanks are going to be filled up and get a new house and a new kitchen and a new car. And so this one guy said -- oh, it was some guy responding to Bobby Jindal. Oh, by the way did you hear about Joe Biden? Joe Biden was mystified how Bobby Jindal got his shift off at 7-Eleven that night to make the speech. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Time out. Suspend speech for explanation. People watching at home. I'm glad this happened. Glad this happened. You think I just made a joke, an ethnic joke about Bobby Jindal, don't you? I didn't. I made a joke about the bigotry of the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden. It was Joe Biden while walking through the train station he knows so well because he's such a real guy, that he made a comment that you can't go into a 7-Eleven without seeing some Indian guy behind the counter. They're all over the place. Now, let a conservative say something like that and he's brought up before John Conyers' committee with Pat Leahy wanting at you next. Many people think I lose my place in these speeches because -- by the way what time is it? We have plenty of time. We have to be out of here by -- We have to be out of here by 6:00 -- okay, depends on how you behave. I'll decide as we go on. What liberalism Democrat, for those of you in the country, I really want you to believe this because it's the truth. I'm not saying it just because I believe it. This is a core. I want the best country we can have. We want the most prosperous people. We want to be growing. We want to lead the world. We want everybody to come here legally. We want this country to be so damn great and we just cringe to watch it basically capitalism be assaulted and our culture be reoriented to where the people that make it work are the enemy. That's not the United States of America. The people that make this country work, the people who pay on their mortgages, the people getting up and going to work, striving in this recession to not participate in it, they're not the enemy. They're the people that hire you. They're the people that are going to give you a job. They're the people that are going to give you a raise, the people that need you to do work for them. President Obama and take your pick of any Democrat love to say we've tried it your way. Meaning Reaganism. We've tried it your way. We tried it your way in the '80s and it didn't work. We tried it your way eight years, the last eight years and it didn't work. Excuse me. Excuse me. Have you ever noticed those of you watching around the world in my first international address to the world, Fox is on some international satellites. They're watching this in the UK right now going. When Obama talks about past economies, he somehow always leaves out the recession of the '80s as worst than this one. Why does he leave it out? Because you know why he leaves it out, America? He leaves it out because we got out of that recession with tax cuts. For those of you watching at home I'm not nervous it's just really hot in here. These people are wired. We got out of the 1980s recession with tax cuts. Do you know that President Obama, in six weeks of his administration, has proposed more spending than from the founding of the country to his inauguration?\n","Now, this is not prosperity. It is not going to engender prosperity. It's not going to create prosperity and it's also not going to advance or promote freedom. It's going to be just the opposite. There are going to be more controls over what you can and can't do, how you can and can't do it, what you can and can't drive, what you can and can't say, where you can and can't say it. All of these things are coming down the pike, because it's not about revenue generation to them, it's about control. They do believe that they have compassion. They do believe they care. But, see, we never are allowed to look at the results of their plans, we are told we must only look at their good intentions, their big hearts. The fact that they have destroyed poor families by breaking up those families by offering welfare checks to women to keep having babies no more father needed, he's out doing something, the government's the father, they destroy the family. We're not supposed to analyze that. We're not supposed to talk about that. We're supposed to talk about their good intentions. They destroy people's futures. The future is not big government. Self-serving politicians. Powerful bureaucrats. This has been tried, tested throughout history. The result has always been disaster. President Obama, your agenda is not new. It's not change, and it's not hope. Spending a nation into generational debt is not an act of compassion. All politicians, including President Obama, are temporary stewards of this nation. It is not their task to remake the founding of this country. It is not their task to tear it apart and rebuild it in their image.\n","It is not their task, it is not their right to remake this nation to accommodate their psychology. I sometimes wonder if liberalism is not just a psychosis or a psychology, not an ideology. It's so much about feelings and the predominant feeling that liberalism is about is about feeling good about themselves and they do that by telling themselves they have all this compassion. You know, if you really want to unhinge a liberal it's hard to do because they're so unhinged now anyway, even after -- but all you have to do is say you know what the things you people do, the things you people believe in are cruel. That's the last way they look at themselves. They are the best people on the -- they're the good people. You tell them that their ideas and that their policies are cruel and the eggs start scrambling. I have learned how to tweak liberals everywhere. I do it instinctively now. Tweak them in the media. And no reason to be afraid of these people. Why in the world would you be afraid of the deranged? There really is no reason to be afraid of them. And there's no reason to assume they're the minority. And there's no reason to let them set all the premises and all the agendas to which we respond to. I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here but everybody asks me and I'm sure it's been a focal point of your convention: What do we do as conservatives? What do we do? How do we overcome this? Well, the one thing, and there are many, but one thing that we can all do is stop assuming that the way to beat them is with better policy ideas right now. I don't want to name any names. It's not the point. But I talk to people about the Obama budget or the Obama Porkulous bill or whatever else TARP 2 whatever it's going to be, and they start talking to me in the terms of process and policy. I say stop it. What do you mean? Who is setting the process or policy? They are. You want to tweak it? No. This is philosophy, folks. This guy, I forgot -- the guy in the focus group after Bobby Jindal said, I didn't want to hear him talk, he said: Republicans and Democrats. Republicans and Democrats. Ladies and gentlemen of the United States of America, that's exactly what your future is about, who wins, Republicans or Democrats, conservatives versus liberals. The notion of partisanship, false premise. Let me define bipartisanship for you. Bipartisanship -- everybody seems to go orgasmic over the concept of bipartisanship. Don't worry, I checked with Fox, that word's okay. Remember, they covered the Lewinsky thing, so that's my -- bipartisanship occurs only after one other result, and that is victory. In other words, let's say as conservatives liberals demand that we be bipartisan with them in Congress. What they mean is: We check our core principles at the door, come in, let them run the show and agree with them. That's bipartisanship to them. To us, bipartisanship is them being forced to agree with us after we politically have cleaned their clocks and beaten them. And that has to be what we're focused on. Why would any of us in this room who hold the core beliefs we believe, somebody tell me where is the compromise on all of this spending? Where is the compromise on all this punishment of the achievers. I don't know.\n","Where is the compromise between good and evil? Should Jesus have cut a different deal? Serious. From the standpoint of what we have to do, folks, this is not about taking a policy or a process that the Democrats have put forward and fighting around the edges. If we're going to convince the minds and hearts of the American people that what's about to happen to them is as disastrous as anything in their lives in peacetime, we're going to have to discuss philosophy with them. We are going to have to talk about principle, because our principles are not present in what's happening here. So where the hell do we go to compromise what we believe in when our principles are not their principles, they're just the opposite of what's happening? The American people -- it's a tough challenge. I admit -- I admit it's a tough challenge, but it's worth it. It's worth it. The way I just defined bipartisanship you could turn it around and liberals will define bipartisanship when we surrender and say okay we give. We're not quitting. We are not giving up. The country is too important. There are certain realities. We don't have the votes in Capitol Hill to stop what's going to happen. What we can do is slow it down, procedure, parliamentary procedures, slow it down and do the best we can to inform the American people of what's really on the horizon. I know it's going to be tough. At some point I don't think it can happen even right now. This is still the honeymoon period, and there's a lot of devotion to the Obama administration. It doesn't have anything to do with intellectual thinking, it's feelings. It's going to take some time for this to play out. But I spoke to David Keene interviewing for my newsletter. I asked him about this. He said they're going to overreach. Wouldn't you say they have? They're going to overreach. At some point, at some point people have got to realize none of this is possible. You can't have people living in homes they don't pay for. You can't have people driving cars they don't pay for. I mean, you can for a while. But after a while the people paying for it -- screw this. We're not putting up with it. And you're going to see -- you're already starting to see evidence of these. All the tea parties that are starting to bubble up out there. Those are great. Fabulous. And here's the big question. Here's the big question. And I ask this again in the context of my first address to the nation. You don't know how I love saying that, how excited I am about this. Aside from the bastardization of the Constitution that the Obama plans are, that TARP is, it's not constitutional. Aside from that, where is the evidence that the people offering all of this have ever succeeded in any similar plans before? There's none. There is no evidence it works. So you say how is he getting it done? Dumb down public education. Dumb down public education. Emotions. And the ongoing -- this is why I think it's such a waste for a man as gifted as President Obama with the communications skills, you know he could wipe out the Republican Party. He can wipe out the Republican Party if he would inspire this country to be the best it could be, but we don't have to worry about that because that's not what he wants. He wants people in fear, angst and crisis, fearing the worst each and every day because that clears the decks for President Obama and his pals to come in with the answers, which are abject failures, historically shown and demonstrated. Doesn't matter. They'll have control of it when it's all over. And that's what they want. Because they think they can do it better. They see these inequalities, these inequities that capitalism produces. How do they fix it? Do they try to elevate those at the bottom? No! They try to tear down the people at the bottom. It's not fair you're up there. So they whack us. That's not what made the country great. And no evidence of it is in play here.\n","John Kerry, who served in Vietnam. Think about this, and, by the way, Barney Frank got involved with this, too. Northern Trust, a bank in Chicago -- by the way, which holds the mortgage to the Messiah's house, purchased by Tony Rezko, Northern Trust holds the mortgage. Northern Trust was forced, like Wells Fargo was forced, to take TARP money. The Wells Fargo CEO said they were taken into Paulson's room and they were given until 5:00 to sign it. They weren't getting out until they did. They wanted it spread all over the banking business. Northern Trust was in there. They didn't want it. They took $1.6 billion. As you know, they went out and they sponsored the LA Riveria Open two weeks ago that Phil Mickelson barely hung on and won. And we find out they hired some liberals to entertain, but it still wasn't good enough. They hired Sheryl Crow. And they hired the rock crooner group Chicago, but they had the audacity, Northern Trust did, to entertain their clients, to try to reward their best customers, to get new customers, banking is in trouble, Northern Trust is trying to do what they always do, what all businesses do, and that is mine for new clients and reward existing good customers. Not since they took $1.6 billion, I guess. The haughty John Kerry wrote a piece of legislation said: He's getting sick and tired, sick and tired of these CEOs using taxpayer money to throw all these lavish parties. And I'm saying where do you get yours, Senator? Sad thing, sad thing is it works. They've created class envy in so many average Americans that they love hearing that. Yeah, you get even with those bank guys. How is it going to improve here? Let me ask a question for those of you watching my first national address. Take the favorite villain you've got, maybe it's John Thain at Merrill Lynch, because he used his own money, his company's own money, his company's own money, to redecorate a bathroom in a office for $1.2 million. By the way, to do that he had to hire a contractor. They got paid. Had to hire a designer and buy furniture, that's called stimulus. And he did it. But all of a sudden John Thain's thrown out. John Thain is thrown out. He's humiliated and embarrassed; how dare he? He did it a year before they took the TARP money. And all these Congressmen are standing up saying this is not going to happen. We are not going to watch these people capping executive pay while Obama tries to live like one. You know, he's trying to emulate the lifestyle he is attacking. That's what liberals do. Two sets of rules: One for them; one for everybody else. But it's coming. See, if you think that John Thain or the Northern Trust CEO, if you love them getting attacked, if you love them being ripped, ask yourself the next day, do you have any more money in your pocket? Is your life any better because that guy got taken out or down by some haughty senator from Massachusetts?\n","If you ask yourself this, you'll realize your life is no better off. That the Democrats and Obama are asking you to feel better simply on the basis that they're going to get revenge for you, but your life isn't going to improve, somebody else's is just going to be destroyed and they want you to be happy over that. That's sick. And that is not the United States of America. Besides, as far as John Kerry is concerned, if it wasn't for his varicose veins he would be totally colorless. Now let's talk about the conservative movement as it were. We, ladies and gentlemen, have challenges that are part and parcel of a movement that feels it has just suffered a humiliating defeat when it's not humiliating. This wasn't a land slide victory, 52 to, what, 46. 58 million people voted against Obama. There would have been more if we would have had a conservative nominee. I don't mean that -- I mean that in an instructive way, as a lead-in to what I'm talking about here. No humiliating defeat here. I can't -- sometimes I get livid and angry. We do have an organizational problem. We have a challenge. We've got factions now within our own movement seeking power to dominate it, and worst of all to redefine it. Well, the Constitution doesn't need to be redefined. Conservative intellectuals, the Declaration of Independence does not need to be redefined and neither does conservatism. Conservatism is what it is and it is forever. It's not something you can bend and shape and flake and form. Thank you. Thank you.\n","For the purposes of this occasion, I'm not going to mention any names, I bet with you I won't have to. People watching my first address to the nation might be curious what I'm talking about. They'll find out in due course, trust me on this. I cringed -- it might have been 2007, late 2007 or sometime during 2008, but a couple of prominent conservative but beltway establishment media types began to write on the concept that the era of Reagan is over. And that we needed to adapt our appeal, because, after all, what's important in politics is winning elections. And so we have to understand that the American people, they want big government. We just have to find a way to tell them we're no longer opposed to that. We will come up with our own version of it that is wiser and smarter, but we've got to go get the WalMart voter, and we've got to get the Hispanic voter, and we've got to get the recalcitrant independent women. And I'm listening to this and I am just apoplectic: The era of Reagan is over? When the hell do you hear a Democrat say the era of FDR is over? You never hear it. Not only that, the President of the United States today thinks he's FDR, thinks he's Abraham Lincoln, and sometimes, Tuesday night, thinks he's Ronald Reagan. Our own movement has members trying to throw Reagan out while the Democrats know they can't accomplish what they want unless they appeal to Reagan voters. We have got to stamp this out within this movement, because it will tear us apart. It will guarantee we lose elections.\n","We have to. You see, to me it's a no-brainer. It's not even something to me: How do you get rid of Reagan from conservatism? The blueprint -- the blueprint for landslide conservative victory is right there. Why in the hell do the smartest people in our room want to chuck it? I know why. I know exactly why. It's because they're embarrassed of some of the people who call themselves conservatives. These people in New York and Washington, cocktail elitists, they get made fun of when the next NASCAR race is on TV and their cocktail buds come up to them, those people are in your party? How do you put up with this? It would be easy to throw them overboard, so as to maintain these cocktail party beltway New York City inside the beltway media relationships. But I tell you: This notion that Reaganism is dead, conservatism needs to be refined, let's take a look at this. We've got to go get the Walmart voter. I opened my remarks tonight by telling the people watching on Fox who we conservatives are. When I look out at you in this audience, I don't see a Walmart voter. And I don't see a black, and I don't see a woman, and I don't see a Hispanic. I see human beings who happen to be fortunate enough to be the luckiest people on earth you are Americans. Conservatism -- for us to make the decision that we've got to figure out policies, to get the Walmart voter -- psst, we've got most of them already, is the bottom line. Conservatism is a universal set of core principles. You don't check principles at the door. This is a battle that we're going to have. And there are egos involved here, too. When the situation like ours exists, there are people who want to lead it. They want to redefine it. Their egos are such that they want to be the next X, whoever it is. So there will be different factions lining up to try to define what conservatism is. And beware of those different factions who seek as part of their attempt to redefine conservatism, as making sure the liberals like us, making sure that the media likes us. They never will, as long as we remain conservatives. They can't possibly like us; they're our enemy. In a political arena of ideas, they're our enemy. They think we need to be defeated. Why do you think -- you all in this room know this. For those of you watching at home, my first address to the nation -- I'm sure you paid close enough attention, that you knew at one time Senator McCain was the favorite Republican of all the cable news networks and the Sunday shows. And they would just -- I mean their tongues would be on the floor. The media people when they knew McCain was coming. And they would treat McCain as the greatest guy in the world. Did you wonder why? You were told he was moderate. He was not strict. He was not an authoritarian, he was able to walk to the other side of the aisle, able to get along with the enemy. And everybody wants love and bipartisanship.\n","That's not why they invited Senator McCain. They invited Senator McCain because he happened to be the loudest at criticizing his own president and his own party and that's what they want, is people from our side -- and there will be factions in our movement, folks, who are going to make an effort to say we have to grow, we can't stay stale, I think I heard the term used the other day. Nothing stale about freedom. There's nothing stale about liberty. There's nothing stale about fighting for it. Nothing stale whatsoever. Freedom. Are you getting tired of standing up, I don't blame you. By the way for those watching on TV you think the standing -- people are just tired. They've been up and out of their chairs 100 times here. Thank you. Freedom -- freedom is the natural yearning of the human spirit as we were endowed by our creator. And the United States of America is the place in the world where that yearning flourishes. Where freedom is expected because it's part of the way we're created.\n","I loved it when the Soviet Union went down and the wall went down and the liberals in our country said you know they may not be ready for freedom over there. They've been oppressed -- yes, liberals will gladly tell you who can have freedom and who can't. And that's what the pieces of legislation is all about, folks, freedom, liberty, economic prosperity, they're all entwined here we'll have to as a conservative movement understand that our job, after we come to an agreement among ourselves, which shouldn't be hard but it's going to be difficult because the people that think they're smarter than everybody else are going to be out there forging alliances with people that try to make themselves look like new power brokers, and they will become the spokesmen, by the way. By the way, explain that to you. This is a funny story. Show you how I can hijack a news cycle even by doing anything. The Tuesday before the inauguration, President Bush invited me to the Oval Office for lunch. And it was on and off the record, some of the conversations. And he brought out, interesting, at the end of it -- my birthday had been the day before. He brought out a chocolate birthday cake, a microphone, and stood beside me with Ed Gillespie and sang happy birthday. Photographers taking pictures. I wish my parents were alive. My parents wouldn't believe my life. They came out of Great Depression. They didn't think it was possible for somebody who did not go to college and even for people who did they didn't think this was possible. Life has changed so much for the better in this country. That's why I cringe when I see what is in store. So as I'm flying home from lunch, I'm watching television and I see that the word has leaked out that Obama is hosting a dinner with conservative media pundits at the home of George Will. I said: I wonder who these people are? In the media one of them is going to have to leak it. Sure as heck, one did. Now, we all know who were there. And let's see -- I can't rather all the names I won't mention any. But let me tell you Obama's purpose. Does anybody really think that Barack Obama had dinner with a bunch of conservatives hoping they would change his mind? Hell no. His purpose -- and his purpose really wasn't to change theirs. His purpose was to anoint them as conservative spokesmen. These are the people that Obama's willing to break bread with. These happen -- some of the people there happen to be the people who think the era of Reagan is over, who believe that conservatism needs to be redefined. Of course Obama would try to lure them in. Well, all of a sudden I land. I get home about 5:00, and my e-mail is jammed with questions from reporters, are you, is that why you took the day off today? Is that why you're not on the air? Are you going to dinner with Obama? By the way, I left out a crucial part of the story. Was this a Monday, Kit? It was a Tuesday. I had forgotten to tell my audience that I was going to miss the next day I signed off the show saying I'll see you tomorrow. That's the last thing I said. The staff reminded me you're not going to be here tomorrow. I came up with a plan, that the guest host the next day would say that I was called out of town to Washington at midnight the night before. Just an innocent little trick on the radio audience. Everybody picked that up and thinks I'm invited to the Obama. So those people that were invited to it got less coverage than I did and I didn't even know about it. It was fun.\n","Conservatives are naturally happy. We seek happiness. We pursue it. It's part of who we are. So what can you do? Live your life. I swear, folks, you do not know in just the everyday life that you live in your homes, your neighborhoods, the favorite word of this administration, your communities. Remember the root word there is \"commune\". Be happy, live your life according to your values and principles. Know you're going to fail no human being is perfect, you're going to make mistakes, but live your life -- you'll be stunned at how many people you impress. Don't be afraid to tell children that they're wrong. They don't know what you do. They simply haven't lived long enough. It's not their fault but they're being fed a bunch of garbage in school and don't be afraid to tell them that they're wrong. Don't go the Oprah route and say gotta be friends with my parents, my kids and foremost. Understand they're going to hate you for a while and they're going to rebel against you and some day they're going to think you're the smartest person they ever met. But you owe them the truth. You owe them the truth about things. You owe them the truth about morality. You owe them the truth about values. You owe them the truth about politics. Next thing, we've got to stop treating voters as children. Somebody says they want something that's bad for them, do you give it to them just to be nice? Or do you tell them, regardless of their age, no, you shouldn't have that? Well, it's none of your business. Maybe not. And then you back out of it. But you still have to have the ability to tell people what's right and wrong. And that's not authoritative. That's not authoritarian. And it's not trying to deny somebody a good time. It's not trying to interrupt somebody's hedonism, pleasure, it's about all of us with shared values trying to make sure that people live the highest quality lives they can. Ultimately it's their decision as to what they do. But the point is don't treat them like especially voters as kids just -- they say they want it okay we'll come up with a plan to give it to you. Have any of you see the movie -- I'd never heard of it, but I happened to get a DVD the other day. Anybody see the movie Swing Vote with Kevin Costner? You know, it's kind of a moronic movie like most things out of Hollywood are. But this is fascinating in the way -- tell you a short story, because a voter screw up in New Mexico there's one voter who is going to elect the president. His vote didn't count because his daughter voted for him. I won't give the whole story away. But Mexico's electoral votes, New Mexico's electoral votes determined. And they have a two-week period before this guy can vote again. So the challenger and the president both relocate to where this guy lives in New Mexico and they end up like the Democrat played by Dennis Hopper stands for antiabortion. The Democrat candidate comes out with a commercial for life. The Republican candidate comes out, because this guy is an idiot and doesn't know what he believes, and every utterance that he makes these politicians react to it throwing their principles on the floor, just to get his vote. Sadly, this is what some of the conservative intellectuals in our movement want to do, essentially. And that we cannot do. We've got to stand for what we believe and treat people as adults and understand they can learn. Go optimism.\n","Joe Biden, ladies and gentlemen, was watching CBS -- when did you start here? Thursday. You might have seen this. The days run together. It might have been Wednesday, but Biden was on the CBS early show. And he was asked -- the anchorette -- sorry. I'm trying to change my ways. I've been doing women summit programs so not to offend women. The anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, went out and got some man on the street questions. And one guy, woman, I think question for Biden. What is in the stimulus package for small business? Biden was clearly stumped because there isn't anything in the stimulus package for small business. So what Biden said, honest to God, what Biden said was: Well, if there's a bridge to your small business, we're going to make sure that bridge stays open so that you can get to your small business and your customers -- honest. I kid you not. Now, of course, the media today is a bunch of hacks they're out there as PR agents they're starting to get a little embarrassed. Maggie Rodriguez says Senator Biden there's a website that answers all these questions. What is the name of the website and Biden says I don't know. He looks off stage. \"Does somebody have the website number?\" I realize those of you watching at home during my first address to the nation, you have never heard liberal Democrats be made fun of in this way. Get used to it.\n","Two other things and we'll get out of here contractually over time. The president's stimulus package, the TARP, the whatever, the budget, relies on one thing for its success. Well, aside from authoritarian government power. It relies on the complacency of the American people. It relies on their belief that they can convince the American people that there's such a crisis that the only government, the only entity that can fix its government, as Obama has said. So they get complacent and they sit around and they wait. See, this is something liberals will never understand about the United States of America and it's right under their noses, right in front of their faces, we are a competitive people. We strive, enough of us do, to be the best. We strive to win. We strive to avoid defeat. Enough of us still do. Don't believe otherwise. The liberals have made efforts to shut that aspect of our nature down. Wherever you live, I am certain that you, when you were a child or your kids today in youth sports are told not to keep score, because the losers, it's just not fair. They'd be humiliated especially if one girl's basketball team can defeat another one 100 to nothing. And let's fire the coach who put that game together. It's so unfair. So let's not keep score. Well, here's the dirty little secret. The kids are keeping score. You know they are. They don't want to lose. They know what winning and losing is. They're saying, well why go out there and put on the pads and play football or T ball if the objective here is to not keep score. So they're keeping score. They get in the car with mom and dad and they tell mom and dad: Yeah, we kicked their butts tonight. Wait a minute, I thought you weren't keeping score. They weren't officially. They keep score. We're competitive people. Adults are doing the same thing.\n","It didn't take long for people to get fired up when they figured out that they're going to be paying mortgages for people who should never have been lent money in the first place for the bogus excuse of maintaining property values in the neighborhood. This is something that -- the complacency of the American people is something they're going to rely on along with their authoritarian efforts to control it. But they will not succeed at this. Because we're not quitters. We don't acquiesce. We're not going to give up the American dream and watch idly while it is restructured and transformed.\n","As I say, we want the best: Happiness for everybody. Now, about my still to me mysteriously controversial comment that I hope President Obama fails. I was watching the Super Bowl. And as you know, I love the Pittsburgh Steelers. So they have this miraculous scoring drive that puts them up by 4. 15 seconds left. Kurt Warner on the field for the Cardinals. And I sure as heck want you to know I hope he failed. I did not want the Cardinals to win. I wanted Warner to make the biggest fool of himself possible. I wanted a sack, I wanted anything. I wanted the Steelers to win. I wanted to win. I wanted the Cardinals to fail.\n","This notion that I want the President to fail, folks, this shows you a sign of the problem we've got. That's nothing more than common sense and to not be able to say it, why in the world do I want what we just described, rampant government growth indebtedness, wealth that's not even being created yet that is being spent, what is in this? What possibly is in this that anybody of us want to succeed? Did the Democrats want the war on Iraq to fail?! They certainly did. They not only wanted the war in Iraq to fail, they proclaimed it a failure. There's Dingy Harry Reid waiving a white flag: [Harry Reid impression] This war is lost. This war is -- They called General Petraeus a liar before he even testified. Mrs. Clinton -- said she had to, willingly suspend disbelief in order to listen to Petraeus. We're in the process of winning the war. The last thing they wanted was to win. They hoped George Bush failed. So what is so strange about being honest to say that I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation? Why would I want that to succeed?\n","Let me add a caveat here. My friends, I know what's going on. I know what's going on. We're in the aspects here of an historic presidency. I know that. But let me be honest again. I got over the historical aspects of this in November. President Obama is our president. President Obama stands for certain things. I don't care, he could be a Martian. He could be from Michigan, I don't know -- just kidding. Doesn't matter to me what his race is. It doesn't matter. He's liberal is what matters to me. And his articulated -- his articulated plans scare me. Now, I understand we can't say we want the President to fail, Mr. Limbaugh. That's like saying -- this is the voice of the New Castrati, by the way, guys who have lost their guts. You can't say Mr. Limbaugh that you want the President to fail because that's like saying you want the country to fail. It's the opposite. I want the country to survive. I want the country to succeed.\n","I want the country to survive as we have known it, as you and I were raised in it, is what I mean. Now, I have been called -- and I can take it. Pioneers take the arrows, I don't mind what anybody says about me, any time ever. I don't have time for it. I don't give other people the power to offend me. And you shouldn't either. By the wasted time being offended. I mean, there's some people you can't say you want the President to fail. Ladies and gentlemen of the United States, the Democrat Party has actively not just sought the failure of Republican presidents and policies and now wars for the first time, the Democrat Party doesn't stop at failure. Talk to Judge Robert Bork or Justice Clarence Thomas about how they tried to destroy lives, reputations and character, and I'm supposed to say I don't want the President to fail? We're in for a real battle. We are talking about the United States of America -- and there will always be an America, don't misunderstand me -- we're talking about it remaining the country we were all born into and reared and grown into. And it's under assault. It's always under assault. But it's never been under assault like this from within before. And it's a serious, serious battle. So as you leave here, as you leave here optimism, confidence, not guilt, it's not worth it. There's nothing to be guilty about. Don't treat people as children. Respect their intelligence. Realize that there's a way to persuade people. Sometimes the worst way is to get in their face and point a finger. Set up a set of circumstances where the conclusion is obvious. Let them think they came up with the idea themselves. They'll think they're smart that they figured it out. Who cares how you persuade them, the fact they can be persuaded is factually correct, it's possible. But the main thing to do here is stop thinking that we are a minority. Stop thinking that it is being in the minority that liberates you. It is your beliefs. It is your core principles, it is your confidence that liberates you. It's not being in the minority. In fact, for those of you watching my first national address and still hanging in there, we really are not that happy about being a minority and we're out to change it. So I have -- I've gone over my allotted time by an hour. I want to thank all of you so much for everything that you have meant to me and my family in my life.\n","I understand it's mutual. And I hear people -- you have made my heart grow so much that it barely fits in my chest cavity here tonight. But the things that by virtue of your listening to my radio show and being active in this movement that we all cherish and love, you have meant more to me, my family and my life than whatever it is I might mean to you, even though I know that's considerable. You still can't outdo the absolute joy and awe and thanks I feel for all of you. I've been doing this for 20 years and the numbers just keep growing. And I can't tell you how appreciative I am and proud to be in a movement with the same passions, desires and core beliefs that all of you have, because we know that it's right for the country, and we know it's right for people. It's not something that has to be forced on them. It's not something that has to be authoritatively pressed on them. We are what is, and that's why we are an enemy because we're effective. The people that do want control look at us as the enemy. We're always going to be -- don't ever measure your success by how many Drive-By Media reports you see that are fair to us. Never going to happen. Don't measure your success by how many people like you. Just worry about how they vote. And then at the end of the day how they live but that's really none of your business once they close the doors.\n","Thank you all very much. It's been great. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john avlon: today's speech is my first ever address to the nation. he says people are probably watching this who never have listened to my program and may not know what conservatism is. they think they do based on how they've been impugned, maligned and so forth. --------------------------\n","690 \n","Original text: Thank you very much.\n","Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President; Members of Congress;\n","the First Lady of the United States;\n","and Citizens of America:\n","Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.\n","What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.\n","In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?\n","I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.\n","We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\n","Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -- families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.\n","But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can we truly make America great again.\n","Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\n","It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.\n","Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\n","The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.\n","We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban -- thank you -- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\n","We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency. And we’re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We’re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.\n","We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\n","We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\n","To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\n","At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.\n","For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.\n","To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\n","Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.\n","We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\n","That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm.\n","As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\n","I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.\n","Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.\n","I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\n","Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.\n","We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\n","Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.\n","Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.\n","At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers. We have to do it. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.\n","I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. And they wanted me to ride one and I said, \"No, thank you.\"\n","At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales? They told me -- without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it -- that it's very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren't even asking for a change. But I am.\n","I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a long time since we had fair trade. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… will produce want and ruin among our people.\" Lincoln was right -- and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer.\n","I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system. It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\n","Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families -- including immigrant families -- enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\n","I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation's security; and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\n","Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program -- the building of the Interstate Highway System. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East -- all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\n","To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital -- creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy American and hire American.\n","Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.\n","Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.\n","Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state -- the state of Kentucky -- and it's unsustainable and collapsing.\n","One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all. There’s no choice left. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.\n","Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\n","Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\n","First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\n","Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts -- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.\n","Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\n","Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.\n","And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines, which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.\n","Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.\n","Our citizens deserve this, and so much more -- so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.\n","My Administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\n","True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.\n","An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\n","Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past five. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\n","Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.\n","But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.\n","Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning -- a great learning center -- with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.\n","Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her master’s degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\n","But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.\n","Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. But to create this future, we must work with, not against -- not against -- the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust -- not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it's what it is, division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.\n","Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\n","And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called VOICE -- Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\n","Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\n","Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.\n","Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\n","To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.\n","Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war -- if they must -- they have to fight and they only have to win.\n","I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.\n","The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\n","We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that -- and I quote -- \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. And Ryan is looking down, right now -- you know that -- and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\n","To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.\n","We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism.\n","But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our partners -- whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific -- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.\n","We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.\n","But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world -- all across the world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\n","America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found.\n","America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.\n","On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\n","Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.\n","When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before -- for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are made by the same God.\n","When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.\n","From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\n","I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.\n","And believe, once more, in America.\n","Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," in nine years, the united states will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding. we've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate, says john edwards. --------------------------\n","691 \n","Original text: October 26, 1986. The sky was a starry blue, a glorious backdrop for possibly the most important moment in history. Yes -- Game 6 of the Boston Red Sox-New York Mets World Series. Bottom of the tenth with two out and Ray Knight on second. Mookie Wilson stood on home plate facing a steely-faced Bob Stanley. Stanley pitched a frozen rough over home plate and Mookie tapped it right down the first baseline. Inside his head, the first baseman heard the call of his name like the voice of God: Bill Buckner -- ner -- ner….\n","It was only Bill and the ball and his faceoff with destiny. Bill pulled out his glove and watched in slow motion as that ball rolled right between his legs. And that was it. The Red Sox lost and Buckner was pegged as the World Series goat. Boston hated him for the loss, and no matter how good his batting average, no matter what previous mistakes had been made in the game, forgiveness for Bill Buckner was completely out of the question.\n","This attitude is not limited to the baseball stadium. In fact, it’s becoming more of the national pastime than baseball itself. Author Greg Easterbrook states in The Progress Paradox that we, now more than ever, live in an age in which the collecting of grievances and the holding of grudges is elaborately encouraged, where forgiveness is not just ignored, it's looked down upon. That's my concern. As a society, too often we choose to live in what I call a state of unforgiveness. We repeatedly refuse to forgive others for errors committed against us, no matter how big or small. Not only are we hurting those we don't forgive, but we're hurting ourselves as well. So, today I'll show you the play by play, as we look at how we wrongly respond to these errors, by first holding grudges, and second, getting even.\n","After the 2004 Red Sox World Series win, many people decided it was time to forgive Billy's mistake. Wait a second. Didn't that happen 18 years ago? Clearly, they had some trouble letting go of old grudges; and they're not alone. Chances are you could think of at least one person who you really haven't forgiven -- like the coworker who constantly took credit for your incredible work, or the competitor who ignored you in a round, or the supposed best friend -- let's call her \"Alexis\" -- who, in tenth grade, tried to steal your boyfriend while supposedly talking to him on your behalf -- let's call him \"Steve.\" And the names have not been changed here, people, because no one is innocent.\n","But, I forgave her. Besides, I won.\n","Studies conducted by the Stanford University Forgiveness Project found that individuals who harbor grudges not only damage their interpersonal relationships, but they also damage themselves. They are more likely to experience high levels of stress, high blood pressure, depression, a suppressed immune system, stress related diseases like fibromyalgia and even heart disease. Or, basically, all of the side effects of Viagra. But, seriously, that's because when we hold feelings of anger and hatred bottled up inside, they often manifest themselves into physical symptoms. Think of it this way: when we harden our hearts toward others, we literally harden our hearts. So ultimately, holding grudges is the game with no winners.\n","Now, the technical definition of an error in baseball is \"a mistake made by a player that gives the opposing team an extra advantage.\" But, in the game of getting even, a mistake made by someone ignites revenge, and rarely does any player have the advantage. Are you harboring resentment towards someone? Well, you could go to RevengeLady.com, a helpful website that offers hints on taking revenge. Vengeance is mine, saith the Revenge Lady. One of my particular favorites on this website is a story about a spiteful secretary who wants to get even with her boss after an argument. Now, they say that revenge is the dish best served cold. So, she injected milk into his desk chair and spread ground beef under his carpet. Now, to our secretary, this may have seemed like a home run, but after her boss found out it was her dirty deed, she found herself, not an all-star, but unemployed.\n","Now while we may laugh at these more ridiculous tales of revenge gone awry, we need to realize that not all tales of revenge are this light-hearted. Take, for example, a story reported in Time Magazine about Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, New York, where students Tyrone Sinclair and Ian Moore, ages16 and 17, were both murdered by fellow student Kaleen Sumter, age 15, in an act of revenge. Sumter had gotten in some fist fights with the boys and one day decided to get even by bringing a gun to school and shooting them both point blank in the hallway. In a four year span at Thomas Jefferson High, 70 students died, and the study prepared for the state of New York found that 50% of all 1,900 students had some kind of puncture wound on their body at any given time. The school has a grieving room where students can seek solace, along with an ongoing burial fund to help families finance funerals.\n","Clearly, for these students, there is no room for human error because revenge has become a way of life.\n","Dr. Robert Enright, the unquestioned pioneer in the scientific study of forgiveness, sees a direct correlation between our ability to forgive and the prevalence of violence in schools, the disintegration of marriage, and the breakdown of family. Maybe that's why studies now show that more than 135,000 students bring guns to school each day, or the divorce rate is now reaching 60%, and why every 26 seconds, a teenager runs away from home.\n","I'll admit that I'm no stranger to bitterness. Very recently, a close friend of mine was hit and killed in a car accident where he was hit head-on by two different vehicles. When I learned of his death, not only was I filled with a deep sorrow, but a burning rage for these two drivers. Why had they been driving so fast? Why weren't they looking where they were going? Out of all the cars on the road, why did they have to hit his? On the day of his funeral, I was still so angry with these men who had taken my friend away from me. His mother got up to deliver her memorial. She said that she missed Chris. She would always miss Chris -- but that she did not blame the two drivers and urged them not to live in guilt over the accident. She said:\n","I can either sow seeds of bitterness and reap unhappiness, or sow seeds of forgiveness and reap joy. I could not choose when Chris would leave this earth, but I can choose to live my life in peace and in grace. Surely if a grieving mother can find room in her heart for forgiveness, then the rest of us can at least try.\n","So, how can we be more like Chris's mom and make the choice to forgive those who have hurt us?\n","Well, Dr. [Fred] Luskin, author of the book Forgive for Good, offers us these basic steps. First, we need to realize that forgiveness is not some catch-all net that lets anything slide. Forgiveness is not the absence of justice, or the condoning of bad behaviors. If someone breaks your window with a baseball, you can forgive them. They should still pay for it. If somebody breaks your heart, they need to know the consequences of their actions. And if your little sister calls you evil, tall girl, she should know that's not an appropriate way to address you. And if you go ahead and eat half of her Halloween candy because of it, well, you should know better.\n","Second, we need to realize that forgiveness is not absolving someone their sin, but rather releasing hurt that was dealt us and moving on with life.\n","Finally, we need to forgive the person or persons who hurt us, whether they asked for forgiveness or not. Ultimately, the choice is ours. After all, change is possible.\n","Think of old Billy himself, who, when asked how he felt about the 2004 Red Sox World Series win, said, \"This is their championship. This is what they did, and I'm happy for them. Besides, they beat the Yankees along the way. I hate the Yankees.\"\n","So, if the Red Sox fans and Bill Buckner can do it, then maybe, even when life throws us a curve, it's time for us to step up to the plate -- and play ball. \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," john sutter: we live in an age in which collecting grievances and holding of grudges is elaborately encouraged. he says we often refuse to forgive others for errors committed against us, no matter how big or small. we're hurting ourselves as well. --------------------------\n","692 \n","Original text: Opening Remarks\n","Prime Minister Rabin; Chairman Arafat; Your Majesty, King Hussein; President Mubarak; Foreign Minister Peres; Mr. Abu Mazin; Prime Ministers Gonzalez, Filali, Bin Shakir; Foreign Minister Kozyrev, our cosponsor of the Middle East peace negotiations; distinguished foreign ministers and members of the Diplomatic Corps; and honored guests:\n","I welcome you to the White House for this milestone on the path to reconciliation. Today we make a great stride for the fulfillment of a vision toward the day when two peoples divided by generations, by conflict, are bound now by peace. Finally, the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel's house, when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny, when the clash of arms will be banished from God's Holy Land.\n","Two years ago, on another brilliant September day here at the White House, two men reached across one of history's widest chasms with a simple handshake. That moment is etched forever in our memory. With the eyes of the world upon you, Mr. Prime Minister [Rabin], you declared your wish to live side by side with the Palestinian people in dignity, in empathy, as human beings, as free men. And you, Mr. Chairman [Arafat], vowed to wage what you called the most difficult battle of our lives, the battle for peace.\n","In the days of labor that have followed, you have both shown profound courage in bringing us to this moment -- and you have kept your word.\n","The enemies of peace have fought the tide of history with terror and violence. We grieve for their victims, and we renew our vow to redeem the sacrifice of those victims. We will defeat those who resort to terror. And we revere the determination of these leaders who chose peace, who rejected the old habits of hatred and revenge. Because they broke so bravely with the past, the bridges have multiplied -- bridges of communication, of commerce, of understanding. Today, the landscape changes and the chasm narrows.\n","The agreement that now will be signed means that Israel's mothers and fathers need no longer worry that their sons will face the dangers of patrolling Nablus or confronting the hostile streets of Ramallah. And it means that Palestinians will be able to decide for themselves what their schools teach, how their houses should be built, and who they will choose to govern.\n","Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chairman, you are showing that it is not by weapons, but by will and by word, that dreams best become reality. Your achievement shines as an inspiration to others all around this world who seek to overcome their own conflicts and to secure for themselves the blessings of peace.\n","Chapter by chapter, Jews and Arabs are writing a new history for their ancient lands: Camp David; the Declaration of Principles, signed here 2 years ago; the peace of the Arava last year between Jordan and Israel: With each of these, the truth of this book has become clear to the world. As courageous leaders stepped beyond the bounds of convention, they build for their peoples a new world of hope and peace.\n","Now, as this new chapter begins, it is fitting that we are joined by so many from the camp of peace. Egypt's President Mubarak has carried forth the commitment to peace that began with Anwar el-Sadat and the miracle at Camp David. Before there was a glimpse of a breakthrough, President Mubarak stood for reconciliation. And he added his strength, his personal strength, time and time again in the days of the negotiations.\n","Today we are also joined by the largest group of Arab foreign ministers ever assembled to support the growth of peace. Prime Minister Filali of Morocco has traveled here to represent King Hassan, who has done so much to advance progress in the region. With us as well are representatives of nations that have provided vital support for peace, including the countries of the European Union, Japan, Canada, and of course, Norway, whose assistance two years ago opened the way to this moment.\n","All those who doubt the spirit of peace should remember this day and this extraordinary array of leaders who have joined together to bring a new era of hope to the Middle East. The United States is proud to stand with all of them.\n","Much remains to be done. But we will continue to walk each step of the way with those who work and risk for peace. We will press forward with our efforts until the circle of peace is closed, a circle which must include Syria and Lebanon if peace is to be complete. We will not rest until Muslims and Jews can turn their backs to pray without any fear; until all the region's children can grow up untouched by conflict, until the shadow of violence is lifted from the land of light and gold.\n","Thank you very much.\n","As we adjourn, let me once again thank all of our guests from across the world who have come here to be a part of this and to wish all the parties well. Let me thank those who spoke today for their contributions to the peace process.s.\n","Let me say a special word of thanks to the members of Congress who have come here from both parties, including both Jewish-Americans and Arab-Americans represented in our United States Congress, for their support of the United States' effort.\n","And let me close with this simple thought: As the cold war has given way to a global village in which the enemies of peace are many and dispersed all across the world, the United States is -- the United States is honored and obligated to be a force for peace, from Northern Ireland to Southern Africa, from Bosnia to Haiti, to reducing the nuclear threat and the threat of biological and chemical weapons to fighting against terrorism and organized crime.\n","But this is special. For it is in this place that those of us who believe that the world was created by, is looked over by, and ultimately will be accountable to one great God. All of us came from there, whether we find that wisdom in the Torah or the Koran or the Christian Holy Bible.

It has thawed in the warmth of our sunshine and melted in the heat of the midday sun. The crack and the rumble of the summer thunders, lashed by startling lightning, have been a cause both of trembling and of hope.\n","The fragrances of nature have been as pleasant to us as the sight of the wild blooms of the citizens of the veld.\n","The dramatic shapes of the Drakensberg, the soil-coloured waters of the Lekoa, iGqili noThukela, and the sands of the Kgalagadi, have all been panels of the set on the natural stage on which we act out the foolish deeds of the theatre of the day.\n","At times, and in fear, I have wondered whether I should concede equal citizenship of our country to the leopard and the lion, the elephant and the springbok, the hyena, the black mamba and the pestilential mosquito.\n","A human presence among all of these, a feature on the face of our native land thus defined, I know that none dare challenge me when I say -- I am an African!\n","I owe my being to the Khoi and the San whose desolate souls haunt the great expanses of the beautiful Cape -- they who fell victim to the most merciless genocide our native land has ever seen, they who were the first to lose their lives in the struggle to defend our freedom and independence and they who, as a people, perished in the result.\n","Today, as a country, we keep an inaudible and audible silence about these ancestors of the generations that live, fearful to admit the horror of a former deed, seeking to obliterate from our memories a cruel occurrence which, in its remembering, should teach us not and never to be inhuman again.\n","I am formed of the migrants who left Europe to find a new home on our native land. Whatever their own actions, they remain still part of me.\n","In my veins courses the blood of the Malay slaves who came from the East. Their proud dignity informs my bearing, their culture a part of my essence. The stripes they bore on their bodies from the lash of the slave master are a reminder embossed on my consciousness of what should not be done.\n","I am the grandchild of the warrior men and women that Hintsa and Sekhukhune led, the patriots that Cetshwayo and Mphephu took to battle, the soldiers Moshoeshoe and Ngungunyane taught never to dishonor the cause of freedom.\n","My mind and my knowledge of myself is formed by the victories that are the jewels in our African crown, the victories we earned from Isandhlwana to Khartoum, as Ethiopians and as Ashanti of Ghana, as Berbers of the desert.\n","I am the grandchild who lays fresh flowers on the Boer graves at St Helena, [unclear], and the Vrouemonument, who sees in the mind's eye and suffers the suffering of a simple peasant folk, death, concentration camps, destroyed homesteads, a dream in ruins.\n","I am the child of Nongqawuse. I am he who made it possible to trade in the world markets in diamonds, in gold, in the same food for which our stomachs yearn.\n","I come of those who were transported from India and China, whose being resided in the fact, solely, that they were able to provide physical labor, who taught me that we could both be at home and be foreign, who taught me that human existence itself demanded that freedom was a necessary condition for that human existence.\n","Being part of all of these people, and in the knowledge that none dares contest that assertion, I shall claim that -- I am an African.\n","I have seen our country torn asunder as these, all of whom are my people, engaged one another in a titanic battle, the one to redress a wrong that had been caused by one to another and the other, to defend the indefensible.\n","I have seen what happens when one person has superiority of force over another, when the stronger appropriate to themselves the prerogative even to annul the injunction that God created all men and women in His image.\n","I know what it signifies when race and color are used to determine who is human and who, sub-human.\n","I have seen the destruction of all sense of self-esteem, the consequent striving to be what one is not, simply to acquire some of the benefits which those who had imposed themselves as masters had ensured that they enjoy.\n","I have experience of the situation in which race and color is used to enrich some and impoverish the rest.\n","I have seen the corruption of minds and souls as a result of the pursuit of an ignoble effort to perpetrate a veritable crime against humanity.\n","I have seen concrete expression of the denial of the dignity of a human being emanating from the conscious, systemic and systematic oppressive and repressive activities of other human beings.\n","There the victims parade with no mask to hide the brutish reality -- the beggars, the prostitutes, the street children, those who seek solace in substance abuse, those who have to steal to assuage hunger, those who have to lose their sanity because to be sane is to invite pain.\n","Perhaps the worst among these, who are my people, are those who have learnt to kill for a wage. To these the extent of death is directly proportional to their personal welfare.\n","And so, like pawns in the service of demented souls, they kill in furtherance of the political violence in KwaZulu-Natal. They murder the innocent in the taxi wars.\n","They kill slowly or quickly in order to make profits from the illegal trade in narcotics. They are available for hire when husband wants to murder wife and wife, husband.\n","Among us prowl the products of our immoral and amoral past -- killers who have no sense of the worth of human life, rapists who have absolute disdain for the women of our country, animals who would seek to benefit from the vulnerability of the children, the disabled, and the old, the rapacious who brook no obstacle in their quest for self-enrichment.\n","All this I know and know to be true because I am an African!\n","Because of that, I am also able to state this fundamental truth that I am born of a people who are heroes and heroines.\n","I am born of a people who would not tolerate oppression.\n","I am of a nation that would not allow that fear of death, of torture, of imprisonment, of exile or persecution should result in the perpetuation of injustice.\n","The great masses who are our mother and father will not permit that the behavior of the few results in the description of our country and people as barbaric.\n","Patient because history is on their side, these masses do not despair because today the weather is bad. Nor do they turn triumphalist when, tomorrow, the sun shines.\n","Whatever the circumstances they have lived through and because of that experience, they are determined to define for themselves who they are and who they should be.\n","We are assembled here today to mark their victory in acquiring and exercising their right to formulate their own definition of what it means to be African.\n","The Constitution whose adoption we celebrate constitutes an unequivocal statement that we refuse to accept that our African-ness shall be defined by our race, our color, our gender or our historical origins.\n","It is a firm assertion made by ourselves that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, Black and White.\n","It gives concrete expression to the sentiment we share as Africans, and will defend to the death, that the people shall govern.\n","It recognizes the fact that the dignity of the individual is both an objective which society must pursue, and is a goal which cannot be separated from the material well-being of that individual.\n","It seeks to create the situation in which all our people shall be free from fear, including the fear of the oppression of one national group by another, the fear of the disempowerment of one social echelon by another, the fear of the use of state power to deny anybody their fundamental human rights and the fear of tyranny.\n","It aims to open the doors so that those who were disadvantaged can assume their place in society as equals with their fellow human beings without regards to color, to race, to gender, to age or to geographic dispersal.\n","It provides the opportunity to enable each one and all to state their views, to promote them, to strive for their implementation in the process of governance without fear that a contrary view will be met with repression.\n","It creates a law-governed society which shall be inimical to arbitrary rule.\n","It enables the resolution of conflicts by peaceful means rather than resort to force.\n","It rejoices in the diversity of our people and creates the space for all of us voluntarily to define ourselves as one people.\n","As an African, this is an achievement of which I am proud, proud without reservation and proud without any feeling of conceit.\n","Our sense of elevation at this moment also derives from the fact that this magnificent product is the unique creation of African hands and African minds.\n","But it also constitutes a tribute to our loss of vanity that we could, despite the temptation to treat ourselves as an exceptional fragment of humanity, draw on the accumulated experience and wisdom of all humankind, to define for ourselves what we want to be.\n","Together with the best in the world, we too are prone to pettiness, to petulance, selfishness and short-sightedness.\n","But it seems to have happened that we looked at ourselves and said the time had come that we make a super-human effort to be other than human, to respond to the call to create for ourselves a glorious future, to remind ourselves of the Latin saying: Gloria est consequenda -- Glory must be sought after.\n","Today it feels good to be an African.\n","It feels good that I can stand here as a South African and as a foot soldier of a titanic African army, the African National Congress, to say to all the parties represented here, to the millions who made an input into the processes we are concluding, to our outstanding compatriots who have presided over the birth of our founding document, to the negotiators who pitted their wits one against the other, to the unseen stars who shone unseen as the management and administration of the Constitutional Assembly, the advisers, the experts and the publicists, to the mass communication media, to our friends across the globe -- congratulations and well done!\n","I am an African.\n","I am born of the peoples of the continent of Africa.\n","The pain of the violent conflict that the peoples of Liberia, and of Somalia, of the Sudan, of Burundi and Algeria is a pain I also bear.\n","The dismal shame of poverty, suffering and human degradation of my continent is a blight that we share.\n","The blight on our happiness that derives from this and from our drift to the periphery of the ordering of human affairs leaves us in a persistent shadow of despair.\n","This is a savage road to which nobody should be condemned.

And as we mark this occasion, we’re also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber, and we pray for the health of our colleague -- and our friend -– Gabby Giffords.\n","It’s no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs. And that’s a good thing. That’s what a robust democracy demands. That’s what helps set us apart as a nation.\n","But there’s a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater -– something more consequential than party or political preference.\n","We are part of the American family. We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.\n","That, too, is what sets us apart as a nation.\n","Now, by itself, this simple recognition won’t usher in a new era of cooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow.\n","I believe we can. And I believe we must. That’s what the people who sent us here expect of us. With their votes, they’ve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties. New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. We will move forward together, or not at all -– for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics.\n","At stake right now is not who wins the next election -– after all, we just had an election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else. It’s whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded. It’s whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world.\n","We are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.\n","But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise. By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.\n","That’s the project the American people want us to work on. Together.\n","We did that in December. Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans’ paychecks are a little bigger today. Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year. And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year.\n","But we have to do more. These steps we’ve taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we’ll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.\n","Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown. You didn’t always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors. If you worked hard, chances are you’d have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion. Maybe you’d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.\n","That world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful. I’ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. I’ve heard it in the frustrations of Americans who’ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear -– proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.\n","They’re right. The rules have changed. In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business. Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100. Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there’s an Internet connection.\n","Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science. They’re investing in research and new technologies. Just recently, China became the home to the world’s largest private solar research facility, and the world’s fastest computer.\n","So, yes, the world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn’t discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember -– for all the hits we’ve taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world. No workers -- no workers are more productive than ours. No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs. We’re the home to the world’s best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth.\n","What’s more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea -– the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny. That’s why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here. It’s why our students don’t just memorize equations, but answer questions like “What do you think of that idea? What would you change about the world? What do you want to be when you grow up?”\n","The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can’t just stand still. As Robert Kennedy told us, “The future is not a gift. It is an achievement.” Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.\n","And now it’s our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time. We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. That’s how our people will prosper. That’s how we’ll win the future. And tonight, I’d like to talk about how we get there. The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation. None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from. Thirty years ago, we couldn’t know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution. What we can do -- what America does better than anyone else -- is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. We’re the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook. In America, innovation doesn’t just change our lives. It is how we make our living.\n","Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because it’s not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need. That’s what planted the seeds for the Internet. That’s what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS. Just think of all the good jobs -- from manufacturing to retail -- that have come from these breakthroughs.\n","Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon. The science wasn’t even there yet. NASA didn’t exist. But after investing in better research and education, we didn’t just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.\n","This is our generation’s Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven’t seen since the height of the Space Race. And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal. We’ll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology -– an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.\n","Already, we’re seeing the promise of renewable energy. Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company. After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon. But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard. Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country. In Robert’s words, “We reinvented ourselves.”\n","That’s what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves. And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we’ve begun to reinvent our energy policy. We’re not just handing out money. We’re issuing a challenge. We’re telling America’s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we’ll fund the Apollo projects of our time.\n","At the California Institute of Technology, they’re developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they’re using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities. With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.\n","We need to get behind this innovation. And to help pay for it, I’m asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies. I don’t know if -- I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but they’re doing just fine on their own. So instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s.\n","Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they’re selling. So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: By 2035, 80 percent of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources.\n","Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all -- and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen.\n","Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America’s success. But if we want to win the future -– if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas -– then we also have to win the race to educate our kids.\n","Think about it. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us –- as citizens, and as parents –- are willing to do what’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.\n","That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities. It’s family that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done. We need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair. We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.\n","Our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many schools don’t meet this test. That’s why instead of just pouring money into a system that’s not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top. To all 50 states, we said, “If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we’ll show you the money.”\n","Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation. For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning. And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country. And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that’s more flexible and focused on what’s best for our kids.\n","You see, we know what’s possible from our children when reform isn’t just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities. Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs. But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first in their families to go to college. And after the first year of the school’s transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, “Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.” That’s what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country.\n","Let’s also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child’s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as “nation builders.” Here in America, it’s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect. We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math.\n","In fact, to every young person listening tonight who’s contemplating their career choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child -- become a teacher. Your country needs you.\n","Of course, the education race doesn’t end with a high school diploma. To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American. That’s why we’ve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students. And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit –- worth $10,000 for four years of college. It’s the right thing to do.\n","Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today’s fast-changing economy, we’re also revitalizing America’s community colleges. Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina. Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town. One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old. And she told me she’s earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too. As Kathy said, “I hope it tells them to never give up.”\n","If we take these steps -– if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take –- we will reach the goal that I set two years ago: By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\n","One last point about education. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens. Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities. But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us. It makes no sense.\n","Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows. I know that debate will be difficult. I know it will take time. But tonight, let’s agree to make that effort. And let’s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation.\n","The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America. To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information -- from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet.\n","Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped. South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports. Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation’s infrastructure, they gave us a “D.”\n","We have to do better. America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System. The jobs created by these projects didn’t just come from laying down track or pavement. They came from businesses that opened near a town’s new train station or the new off-ramp.\n","So over the last two years, we’ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry. And tonight, I’m proposing that we redouble those efforts.\n","We’ll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges. We’ll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] what’s best for the economy, not politicians.\n","Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail. This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying –- without the pat-down. As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.\n","Within the next five years, we’ll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans. This isn’t just about -- this isn’t about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls. It’s about connecting every part of America to the digital age. It’s about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world. It’s about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.\n","All these investments -– in innovation, education, and infrastructure –- will make America a better place to do business and create jobs. But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success.\n","For example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change.\n","So tonight, I’m asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years –- without adding to our deficit. It can be done.\n","To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up. Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States. And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans -- and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible.\n","Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs. That’s what we did with Korea, and that’s what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks.\n","To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I’ve ordered a review of government regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them. But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people. That’s what we’ve done in this country for more than a century. It’s why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It’s why we have speed limits and child labor laws. It’s why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. And it’s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.\n","Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law. So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved. If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you. We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.\n","What I’m not willing to do -- what I’m not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition.\n","I’m not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered. I’m not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees. As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients’ -- parents’ coverage.\n","So I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let’s fix what needs fixing and let’s move forward.\n","Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren’t buried under a mountain of debt.\n","We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people’s pockets.\n","But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable. Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same.\n","So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.\n","This freeze will require painful cuts. Already, we’ve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years. I’ve proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs. The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without.\n","I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I’m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without. But let’s make sure that we’re not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens. And let’s make sure that what we’re cutting is really excess weight. Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may make you feel like you’re flying high at first, but it won’t take long before you feel the impact.\n","Now, most of the cuts and savings I’ve proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget. To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough. It won’t.\n","The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear. I don’t agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress. And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it –- in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.\n","This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit. The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit. Still, I’m willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.\n","To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations. We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market.\n","And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can’t afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break. It’s not a matter of punishing their success. It’s about promoting America’s success.\n","In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code. This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them.\n","So now is the time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress –- Democrats and Republicans -– to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done. If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future.\n","Let me take this one step further. We shouldn’t just give our people a government that’s more affordable. We should give them a government that’s more competent and more efficient. We can’t win the future with a government of the past.\n","We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then there’s my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they’re in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they’re in saltwater. I hear it gets even more complicated once they’re smoked.\n","Now, we’ve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years, and we’ll cut through red tape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote –- and we will push to get it passed.\n","In the coming year, we’ll also work to rebuild people’s faith in the institution of government. Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you’ll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history. Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done -- put that information online. And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren’t larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it. I will veto it.\n","The 21st century government that’s open and competent. A government that lives within its means. An economy that’s driven by new skills and new ideas. Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation. It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.\n","Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges. No single wall separates East and West. No one rival superpower is aligned against us.\n","And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion. And America’s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity. And because we’ve begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America’s standing has been restored.\n","Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high. American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed. This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq. America’s commitment has been kept. The Iraq war is coming to an end.\n","Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us. Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we’re disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies. And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family.\n","We’ve also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad. In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces. Our purpose is clear: By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.\n","Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency. There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance. But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them. This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead. And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home.\n","In Pakistan, al Qaeda’s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield. Their safe havens are shrinking. And we’ve sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you.\n","American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war. Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed. Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\n","Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons.\n","This is just a part of how we’re shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity. With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense. We’ve reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India.\n","This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas. Around the globe, we’re standing with those who take responsibility -– helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.\n","Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power -– it must also be the purpose behind it. In south Sudan -– with our assistance -– the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war. Thousands lined up before dawn. People danced in the streets. One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him: “This was a battlefield for most of my life,” he said. “Now we want to be free.”\n","And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator. And tonight, let us be clear: The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.\n","We must never forget that the things we’ve struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere. And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country.\n","Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families. Let us serve them as well as they’ve served us -- by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation.\n","Our troops come from every corner of this country -– they’re black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim. And, yes, we know that some of them are gay. Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love. And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past. It is time to move forward as one nation.\n","We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit –- none of this will be easy. All of it will take time. And it will be harder because we will argue about everything. The costs. The details. The letter of every law.\n","Of course, some countries don’t have this problem. If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed. If they don’t want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn’t get written.\n","And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn’t a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth.\n","We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution. We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try. We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible. No matter who you are. No matter where you come from.\n","That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight. That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me. That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father’s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth.\n","That dream -– that American Dream -– is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era. It’s what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future. And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher.\n","Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology. And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them.\n","But Brandon thought his company could help. And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B. His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment. And Brandon left for Chile.\n","Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour -- three or four days at a time without any sleep. Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued. But because he didn’t want all of the attention, Brandon wasn’t there when the miners emerged. He’d already gone back home, back to work on his next project.\n","And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, “We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.”\n","We do big things.\n","From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That’s how we win the future.\n","We’re a nation that says, “I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.” “I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.” “I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.” “I’m not sure how we’ll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we’ll get there. I know we will.”\n","We do big things.\n","The idea of America endures. Our destiny remains our choice. And tonight, more than two centuries later, it’s because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.\n","Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\n","Text, Audio, Image (Pete Souza) Source: WhiteHouse.gov \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," new laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. we will move forward together, or not at all - for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and larger than politics. at stake right now is not who wins the next election, after all, we just had an election. --------------------------\n","695 \n","Original text: No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\n","Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\n","I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them?\n","Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free -- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending -- if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained -- we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\n","They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable -- and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.\n","It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace -- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! \n","\n","Summarized text: \n"," the questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country. for my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of debate. eric liu: it is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. --------------------------\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
