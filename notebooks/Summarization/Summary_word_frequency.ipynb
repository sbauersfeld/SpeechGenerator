KIRBY: I don't have any specific information about a Buk system making that transit. It is a -- it is a sophisticated -- that said, it's a sophisticated system. REAR ADM. KIRBY: I said it strains credulity to think that they could do this without some measure of Russian support and assistance. REAR ADM. KIRBY: I -- look, there's a lot that's gonna be investigated, and I think we want to -- we want to let investigators do their work. Q: What is the level of their training and systems? REAR ADM. KIRBY: Well there have been Russian, I mean there have been incursions across the border by Russian aircraft. REAR ADM. KIRBY: I won't get into the thought process behind the President's specific decisions, but clearly these are another round of targeted sanctions designed to change the calculus and President Putin's behavior and his decision making. REAR ADM. KIRBY: We don't know. Q: What is your theory, what is your working theory? REAR ADM. KIRBY: I don't think we have a working theory at this point, Justin.

KIRBY: We believe that there -- there are -- there is Russian support for the separatists inside Ukraine, yes. REAR ADM. KIRBY: Well, I don't know exactly what system he was referring to, but -- but we would agree with his assessment that they -- some separatists have received some training in these vehicle-borne systems. There's no question about that. I just don't know right now. REAR ADM. KIRBY: It is pretty serious. Phil. REAR ADM. KIRBY: I would just say that we're monitoring events as closely as we can, and I really don't have anything more to add than that? REAR ADM. KIRBY: We're monitoring events as closely as we can. I don't know what prompted it but I think it was obviously -- if you're going to issue a warning like that, it's -- it's based on concerns that you have about surface-to-air missile activity and capabilities. Yeah. And if so, how are you preparing? REAR ADM. KIRBY: On your first question, I don't know. I just don't have that level of visibility. REAR ADM. KIRBY: Well, I mean, just yesterday?

I just don't have any specific indication of that, and I wouldn't talk to it right now. I just don't -- I don't have it. REAR ADM.

Secretary General Stoltenberg: Excellent orange juice and some toast and some fruit salad and a good breakfast. Secretary General Stoltenberg: Paid [for] by the United States. Secretary General Stoltenberg: So President Trump has stated many times his commitment to NATO and also to our Collective Defense Clause and this was also an issue we addressed today but for instance when we met in the White House in May he stated that to me but also at a press conference in connection with the meeting he was also very clear on his commitment to Article 5 Collective Defense Clause. Secretary General Stoltenberg: You know my main task is to keep 29 allies together and therefore perhaps it is not so useful if I start to reflect and comment on all different hypotheses and ideas about what different political leaders think and believe. Secretary General Stoltenberg: Of course it is a political challenge that we have disagreements partly on issues which are not directly related to NATO but of course this agreement on trade is serious and my task is to try to minimize the negative impact on NATO from those disagreement. Secretary General Stoltenberg: So far it hasn’t impacted NATO that much. So I think we understand that the transatlantic bond is not one bond there are many ties. Defense security has been strengthened, trade of course has been weakened. Secretary General Stoltenberg: I said that because I think it is important to convey the message that the transatlantic bond, that NATO has a cornerstone of transatlantic security, it’s not written in stone that we will be there forever, it’s not a law in nature that we will have NATO forever. Secretary General Stoltenberg: So we don’t see any imminent threat against any NATO ally. Secretary General Stoltenberg: Absolutely but my approach to Russia is that we need to combine two things.

Secretary General Stoltenberg: NATO is a transatlantic alliance of course our main responsibility is in the transatlantic area. Secretary General Stoltenberg: He has a clear message I think that has increased the understanding of the importance of defense spending and what we see is that defense spending has started to increase. So I think that is what I have to say about that. Secretary General Stoltenberg: Yeah, meaning that my task is to make sure that we stay together. Secretary General Stoltenberg: So if I started to freely reflect on all the possibilities then I would undermine the unity of this alliance. Difference history. Different geography. Different political leaders.

Still, a number of factors continue to impede progress in the housing market. On the demand side, many would-be buyers are deterred by worries about their own finances or about the economy more generally. Moreover, although the housing market has shown improvement, the contribution of this sector to the recovery is less than has been typical of previous recoveries. Moreover, the possibility that the situation in Europe will worsen further remains a significant risk to the outlook. At the same time, we have been focusing on improving the resilience of our financial system to severe shocks, including those that might emanate from Europe.

BLITZER: Now let's go back to the diplomatic effort involving the United States to try to put together a coalition against terrorism. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for joining us. SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the prime suspect, I think, is the al-Qaida organization, which is essentially a holding company of terrorist organizations that have worldwide presence. MR. BLITZER: Do you believe that other terrorist organizations were cooperating with al-Qaida and Usama bin Laden? SECRETARY POWELL: We don't have enough information yet to make that case, but we are looking at every lead we have. MR. BLITZER: Is there any evidence that any state in the region or around the world may have supported, financed, directed, this operation? SECRETARY POWELL: We have not seen any such links yet, but you can believe we are working hard to see whether such links exist. MR. BLITZER: How do you do that? SECRETARY POWELL: Well, as you know, the FBI and other agencies of government are hard at work. Some 4,000 FBI agents are working on this. MR. BLITZER: When you say long term, how long? SECRETARY POWELL: We're probably going to be in the counter-terrorism business at a very high level of intensity for as long as anyone can imagine, as long as there are people out there who are willing to do the kinds of things those terrorists did this week, then we're going to have to be on guard and constantly looking for them, trying to penetrate them and trying to stop them -- and not just respond to them, but to stop them; get ahead of them, to get inside their decision cycle. MR. BLITZER: This is not weeks or months, but this is years? SECRETARY POWELL: No, no. And we'll get the evidence and we'll get the goods on them. And we'll go after them. And they are all outraged. MR. BLITZER: As you know, Usama bin Laden and al-Qaida, his organization, have operated within Afghanistan, supported -- if you will -- by the Taliban regime over there. SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we're not talking to them right now. MR. BLITZER: Do you have any expectation that they will change their policy and cooperate now with the US and the west and arrest, if you will, Usama bin Laden? SECRETARY POWELL: I'm not carrying an expectation. They either do or they don't. And all, all the indications point in that direction. MR. BLITZER: Now, specifically what does that mean to the Taliban, who may be watching right now? SECRETARY POWELL: They will --\n","MR. BLITZER: What kind of consequences will they suffer? SECRETARY POWELL: They will suffer consequences. MR. BLITZER: As you well know, there have been reports over the years that this organization, al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden's troops and forces, have also operated in Yemen, in Sudan, and other countries. SECRETARY POWELL: Yes. MR. BLITZER: There are reports this morning that the Government of Pakistan is now about to send a delegation into Afghanistan and demand the arrest of Usama bin Laden. SECRETARY POWELL: We have asked Pakistan for a number of things. But we will wait to see, but I am not in a position right now to confirm it. MR. BLITZER: Have you been in direct touch -- I know the President has spoken to President Musharraf, Pervez Musharraf, the leader of Pakistan. SECRETARY POWELL: Well, as you know, the President did speak to him yesterday. They have come forward with a very supportive statement. They have said yes. MR. BLITZER: When will that team leave, and who will head the delegation? SECRETARY POWELL: It's not yet been decided, but I am sure it will not be in the distant future -- I would expect in the very near future, the next several days. MR. BLITZER: One of the statements issued by the Government of Pakistan is that they will cooperate as long as you don't get the Israelis and the Indians -- the Government of Israel and the Government of India involved in this because presumably they would be embarrassed. SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we'll see what their position is. We'll talk to them. MR. BLITZER: Have the Pakistanis agreed to allow the US to go over their air space with missiles or with planes if, in fact, there is going to be a military operation aimed at Afghanistan? SECRETARY POWELL: What we are going to do is sit down with the Pakistanis and discuss with them what we might need. MR. BLITZER: What about their ground positions as staging points? And when we do it will be in a confidential channel so we are not giving any indication of what we might or might not be doing militarily. MR. BLITZER: If you look at the map of Afghanistan, it's landlocked. SECRETARY POWELL: We will be talking to the Uzbek authorities. But we will explore that with them. They have been forthcoming. MR. BLITZER: And as you know to the west is Iran. SECRETARY POWELL: Iran has always had difficulty with the Taliban regime and recognized the nature of that regime. MR. BLITZER: So you would want them specifically, for example, to back off in their support of Hezbollah? SECRETARY POWELL: Yes, they can't say we will help you fighting terrorism here but we will not help you fighting terrorism elsewhere. Terrorism is terrorism. And Hezbollah is a threat to the region, just as al-Qaida is a threat to the world. MR. BLITZER: Are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other states in the Gulf, in the Persian Gulf region with whom the United States has close relations, are they ready to cooperate militarily with the United States in this new war? SECRETARY POWELL: They are ready to cooperate. They have all been supportive. I am pleased with that. MR. BLITZER: Where does the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, fit into this entire scenario for war? SECRETARY POWELL: Well, he is one of the more despicable persons on the face of the Earth, and we have not heard of course -- and wouldn't expect to hear from the Iraqis -- any sense of understanding of this loss of life and the fact that not just the United States, but 40 other nations, to include Arab nations who lost lives in the World Trade Center. MR. BLITZER: Over the years since your experience as a young officer in Vietnam and during the course of your more subsequent experience, you have come up with what is called The Powell Doctrine: a defined mission, overwhelming force, exit strategy. SECRETARY POWELL: To make sure that nothing like this happens again; and to make sure nothing like this happens again by going after the sources, the terrorist sources and those who harbor terrorist activities and terrorist groups; and destroying those networks, those groups; and making sure it is no longer in anyone's interest to harbor or provide haven to such groups. MR. BLITZER: It sounds like a very broadly defined mission. SECRETARY POWELL: It isn't. No, I think it's pretty specific. It is a broad mission, but it is a very specific mission. MR. BLITZER: Overwhelming force. SECRETARY POWELL: It requires political, diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, financial and military effort -- all coming together in a campaign. MR. BLITZER: Presumably, beyond the 50,000 reservists and National Guard troops who are being activated, the number could go way up. SECRETARY POWELL: But don't just see it in terms of activating reservists. They were in this country legally. MR. BLITZER: And what is the exit strategy? SECRETARY POWELL: That was never part of the Powell Doctrine, but I'll accept the question. They can't destroy our society. They can't destroy who we are. They can't destroy America. MR. BLITZER: Since 1976 when President Ford was in the White House, there has been this executive order on the books. Let me read it to you. SECRETARY POWELL: It is still on the books, and as part of our campaign plan we are examining everything -- how the CIA does its work, how the FBI and Justice Departments does its work. MR. BLITZER: What is the difference now, as opposed to ten years ago when you led the US military? SECRETARY POWELL: That war was easy to see, easy to define, with an enemy that essentially sat there waiting to be attacked when we finally did attack it. And when we find them and fix them, then we will go in and finish them. MR. BLITZER: So what I am hearing you saying is that there still may be terrorists at large even here in the United States right now? SECRETARY POWELL: I can't ignore that possibility. It would be foolish to do so. MR. BLITZER: And finally --\n","SECRETARY POWELL: At the same time, even though there may be people wandering around, America has got to get back to work.

These projections are conditional on each participant's individual assessment of the appropriate path of monetary policy needed to best promote the committee's objectives. Consequently, and given that these projections are based on the assumption that monetary policy is appropriate, these longer run projections can be interpreted as indicating the inflation rate that committee participants judge to be most consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices. These projections are a little below those made by the committee in January. Consequently, the committee expects the effects on inflation of higher commodity prices to be transitory. As the increases in commodity prices moderate, inflation should decline toward its underlying level. Monetary policy affects output and inflation with a lag. Thus, the committee's projections of the economy, not just current conditions alone, must guide its policy decisions.

Vice President Biden and I have known each other for a lot of years now, more than 40, if you're counting. We knew each other back when we were young and handsome and smarter than everyone else but were too modest to say so.\n","Joe was already a senator, and I was the Navy's liaison officer to the Senate. My duties included -- as he mentioned earlier -- escorting senate delegations on overseas trips, and in that capacity, I supervised the delegation's luggage, which could require -- now and again when no one of lower rank was available for the job -- that I carry someone else's bag. Once or twice that turned out to be the young senator from Delaware.\n","I've resented it ever since.\n","Joe has heard me joke about that before. I hope he has heard, too, my profession of gratitude for his friendship and love these many years. It's meant a lot to me. We -- We served in the Senate together for over 20 years, during some eventful times, as we passed from young men to the fossils who appear before you this evening.\n","We didn't always agree on the issues. We often argued -- sometimes passionately. But we believed in each other's patriotism and the sincerity of each other's convictions. We believed in the institution we were privileged to serve in. We believed in our mutual responsibility to help make the place work and to cooperate in finding solutions to our country's problems. We believed in our country and in our country's indispensability to international peace and stability and to the progress of humanity. And through it all, whether we argued or agreed, Joe was good company. You all know -- he is good company. So thank you, old friend, for your company and your service to America.\n","Thank you, too, to the National Constitution Center, and everyone associated with it for this award. Thank you for that video, and for the all too generous compliments paid to me this evening. I'm aware of the prestigious company the Liberty Medal places me in. I'm humbled by it, and I'll try my best not to prove too unworthy of it.\n","Some years ago, I was present at an event where an earlier Liberty Medal recipient spoke about America's values and the sacrifices made for them. It was 1991, and I was attending the ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The World War II veteran, estimable patriot and good man, President George Herbert Walker Bush, gave a moving speech at the USS Arizona memorial. I remember it very well. His voice was thick with emotion as he neared the end of his address. I imagine he was thinking not only of the brave Americans who lost their lives on December 7th, 1941, but of the friends he had served with and lost in the Pacific where he -- where he had been the Navy's youngest aviator.\n","\"Look at the water here, clear and quiet\" he directed,\n","One day, [in] what now seems another lifetime...it wrapped its arms around the finest sons any nation could ever have, and it...carried them to a better world.\n","He could barely get out the last line, \"May God bless them. And may God bless America, the most wondrous [land] on Earth.\"\n","The most wondrous land on earth, indeed.\n","I've had the good fortune to spend 60 years in service to this wondrous land. It's not been perfect service, to be sure, and there were probably times when the country might have benefited from a little less of my help. But I've tried to deserve the privilege as best I can, and I've been repaid a thousand times over with adventures, with good company, and with the satisfaction of serving something more important than myself, of being a bit player in the extraordinary story of America. And I am so grateful.\n","What a privilege it is to serve this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, magnificent country. With all our flaws, all our mistakes, with all the frailties of human nature as much on display as our virtues, with all the rancor and anger of our politics, we are blessed.\n","We are living in the land of the free, the land where anything is possible, the land of the immigrant's dream, the land with the storied past forgotten in the rush to the imagined future, the land that repairs and reinvents itself, the land where a person can escape the consequences of a self-centered youth and know the satisfaction of sacrificing for an ideal, the land where you can go from aimless rebellion to a noble cause, and from the bottom of your class to your party's nomination for President.\n","We are blessed, and we've been a blessing to humanity in turn. The international order we helped build from the ashes of world war, and that we defend to this day, has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. This wondrous land -- This wondrous land has shared its treasures and ideals and shed the blood of its finest patriots to help another -- to help make another, better world. And as we did so, we made our own civilization more just, freer, more accomplished and prosperous than the America that existed when I watched my father go off to war on December 7th, 1941.\n","We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. We are the custodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad. We've done great good in the world. That leadership has had its costs, but we have become incomparably powerful and wealthy as we did. We have a moral obligation to continue in our just cause, and we would bring more than shame on ourselves if we don't. We will not thrive in a world where our leadership and ideals are absent. We wouldn't deserve to.\n","I'm the luckiest guy on earth. I have served America's cause -- the cause of our security and the security of our friends, the cause of freedom and equal justice -- all my adult life. I haven't always served it well. I haven't even always appreciated what I was serving. But among the few compensations of old age is the acuity of hindsight. I see now that I was part of something important that drew me along in its wake even when I was diverted by other interests. I was, knowingly or not, along for the ride as America made the future better than the past.\n","And I've enjoyed it, every single day of it, the good ones and the not so good ones. I've been inspired by the service of better patriots than me. I've seen Americans make sacrifices for our country and her causes and for people who were strangers to them but for our common humanity, sacrifices that were much harder than the service ever asked of me. And I've seen the good they've done, the lives they've freed from tyranny and injustice, the hope they encouraged, the dreams they've made achievable.\n","May God bless them. May God bless America, and give us the strength and wisdom, the generosity and compassion, to do our duty for this wondrous land, and for the world that counts on us. With all its suffering and danger, the world still looks to the example and leadership of America to become another, better place. What greater cause could anyone ever serve.\n","Thank you again for this honor. I'll treasure it. \n"," summary:  Joe was already a senator, and I was the Navy's liaison officer to the Senate.
